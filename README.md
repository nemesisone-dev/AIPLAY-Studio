AIPLAY Studio is a local creative suite built around music. Type a few lines of
lyrics and a style, press **Create**, and a finished song lands in your library.
From there the same app can draw its cover art, turn it into a music video, and
mix it in a real DAW.

In the default local mode, everything runs on your own computer. Nothing is uploaded,
nothing is billed, and you never need an account. The optional RunPod preview above
uses a remote worker instead.

<p align="center">
  <img src="GitHubAssets/AIPLAY_banner_1_make-music.png" alt="The Music screen: lyrics, styles and a library of finished songs." width="100%">
</p>

**Only want music? You are in the right place.** Music only is a launch mode of
this same app, **not a separate GitHub repository or edition**. To make songs
with native YuE2 GGUF you do not need ComfyUI, Python, MiniMax or any image and
video models.

**No strong graphics card?** Two ways, in this order:

1. **Ask a friend with a strong card to render for you.** It is free. In Full
   Studio, add each other once on **Collab**, then press **Ask friend** beside a
   scene (Music video → Video clips) and send them the sealed file it makes; they
   send the finished clip back as a file for you to look at before you keep it.
   Nothing connects to anybody: you pass the files on however you already send
   files. It lends video scenes, not songs, one scene per sealed file. Lending
   is built but not yet tried between two PCs. See [Ask a friend to render](docs/FRIEND_RENDERING.md)
   and [Collab](docs/COLLAB.md).
2. **Or pay for a service with your own key.** Both are off until you switch
   them on, and every paid run asks first. Studio uses only a key typed into
   Studio on your Windows account, never one from another program or an
   environment variable, and each key card says when it was saved and by which
   copy of Studio.
   - **Songs:** Full Studio's hosted engine runs MiniMax Music 3 on your own
     fal.ai key, with a monthly cap. Paste the key in **Settings → No strong
     graphics card? → Hosted engine**.
   - **Pictures, clips, sound and 3D:** the launcher's **Use Comfy API** mode
     runs hosted models through
     [Comfy Router](https://docs.comfy.org/development/comfy-router/quickstart)
     on your own Comfy API key and credits, with no ComfyUI and no card. Get a
     key at [platform.comfy.org](https://platform.comfy.org/profile/api-keys),
     choose **Use Comfy API** in the launcher and paste it on the page, or run
     `npm run start:cloud`. That mode has no Music, Music video or Collab screen,
     so a music video still needs Full Studio. Full Studio and Music only never
     spend Comfy credits.

## YuE2 music-only quickstart

Works on **Windows x64 with any card**: setup picks audio.cpp's CUDA build on
NVIDIA, its official Vulkan build on AMD and Intel, and its CPU build when there
is no graphics card at all.

**You need:** Windows x64. Setup.exe brings its own Node.js 20 or newer when the PC has none; from the
source ZIP you install [Node.js 20 or newer](https://nodejs.org) yourself. On NVIDIA you also need
a CUDA 13.3-compatible driver and, if it is missing, the
[Microsoft Visual C++ v14 x64 Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).
The Vulkan and CPU builds bring their own.

1. **Download and run [AIPLAY Studio Setup.exe](https://github.com/Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio/releases/latest/download/AIPLAY.Studio.Setup.exe)**.
   Windows may say “Windows protected your PC” because the installer is not
   signed yet: click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. When it asks which
   build, choose **Senzu's**; then a folder, where the default is right. No
   admin prompt.
   (Developers: the [source ZIP](https://github.com/Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) works too; open the extracted folder,
   not the ZIP viewer.)
2. **Start AIPLAY Studio** from the shortcut Setup made (it is `AIPLAY Studio.exe`;
   from the ZIP, double-click that file or `AIPLAY Studio.cmd`) and choose
   **Music only**. The first run installs what the app needs, then opens Studio
   in your browser. Keep the launcher running while you work.
3. Go to **Models → Review Q4 / Q8 setup** and pick **Q4_0** (smaller, the
   default) or **Q8_0** (optional, higher precision). Read the size and licence,
   accept if you agree, and click **Install**.
4. Open **Music**. A new install opens it on **Simple**: choose one of the
   **Presets…** and press **Make song**. To write your own words, press
   **Advanced**, fill in **Lyrics** and **Style**, and press **Create**.
   Finished songs appear as WAV files in the **Library**.

**What gets downloaded?** About **2.93 GB** of model files for Q4 (**4.53 GB**
for Q8), plus **833 MB** for the shared native runtime. Nothing downloads until
you take an explicit action: picking a model or asking for a song never starts
a download on its own. Q8 has not been benchmarked or listening-tested in
Studio yet, so treat it as optional rather than a guaranteed upgrade.

**Prefer a terminal?** In the extracted folder:

```text
npm ci --omit=dev
npm run start:music
```

**Already running Studio?** Update the same checkout. Let running songs finish
and close Studio before switching modes, because both use
`http://127.0.0.1:4173`. Choose **Full Studio** in the launcher when you want
the whole suite.

**Good to know:** one Q4 test on an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 16 GB made 49.4 seconds
of audio in 22.0 seconds. A minimum amount of graphics memory has not been
certified yet. The YuE2 weights' licence file reads **CC BY-NC 4.0**; the
model's authors have said individuals may sell what it makes and companies need
a commercial licence (15 Sep 2026), and Studio's label follows that statement.
Read the [hardware notes, troubleshooting and licence details](docs/YUE2_GGUF.md)
before you publish or sell anything; the label is not a ruling on every song you
make.

## What you can make

<p align="center">
  <img src="GitHubAssets/AIPLAY_banner_2_song-to-video.png" alt="One studio: from a song on the Music screen to a video on the Studio timeline." width="100%">
</p>

It started as a music generator and grew one piece at a time, because a song
wants a cover, a cover wants a video, and all of it wants a mixer.

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎵 **Music** | Songs from lyrics and a style, or instrumentals from a structure. Extend a take, replace a section, re-roll the mix, hum a melody, or cover a song with its tune kept. **Carry on from a real recording** — a track you own becomes the codes the model speaks, and the render continues it: measured at 0.9947 similarity to its source where a fresh render holds -0.003. The same codes make the library searchable by how a song sounds rather than by what it is called. Engines: YuE2 (native GGUF or through ComfyUI), MiniMax Music 3, and [ACE-Step 1.5](docs/DEEP_DIVE.md#ace-step-15) with LoRAs and covers. |
| 💬 **Chat and Simple mode** | Describe the song you want in plain words and let the assistant write the lyrics, style and title for you. |
| ✨ **Enhance and galleries** | One click turns a rough style line or lyrics into a fuller one. Save the ones you like and reuse them later. |
| 🎰 **Genre Roulette** | Spin six reels (genre, vocals, instrument, mood, rhythm, production) when you have no idea where to start. |
| 🖼️ **Images** | Qwen Image 2.1 is the fresh-install default for images and automatic song covers, with ordered references and an image editor. Existing saved cover choices are preserved. FLUX.2 klein, Z-Image, Krea 2, Anima, Ideogram 4 and compatible custom checkpoints remain available. Choose model downloads explicitly in Models; Qwen requires native files and a compatible runtime. |
| 🎬 **Video** | Clips under a finished track, a music-video workflow from song to final cut, and a camera you can block in Blender for the render to follow. |
| 🌀 **Reactive** | Pictures that move with a song: cut on the beat, pulse with the bass, flash on the hits. Five cut-and-dissolve styles run on the compositor alone and work on any card, AMD included. Two more repaint a clip frame by frame so the figure moves and the look turns with the music, with a black circle that opens on the bass. |
| ⚭ **Collab** | Make an episode with friends, and **lend each other a graphics card**. A project or one scene travels as a sealed file addressed to one person; an order asking a friend to render a scene carries four words and nothing else, and the take comes home to quarantine for you to adopt or throw away. Nothing on the screen opens a connection and there is no server in it. See [COLLAB.md](docs/COLLAB.md). |
| ✂️ **Edit and mix** | A timeline editor, an After Effects-style compositor, and a DAW with a piano roll, mixer and mastering. |
| 📚 **More** | An audiobook workflow, stems, timed lyrics, 3D models from a picture, overnight batch runs, and a little game for while you wait. |

The [deep dive](docs/DEEP_DIVE.md) covers every one of these in detail, and
[`examples/`](examples/) shows real requests next to what they produced.

## Chat, Simple mode and Enhance

**Simple mode** is the easiest way in: describe your idea ("a slow synthwave
song about driving home at 3am") and the assistant writes the lyrics, the style
and a title, ready for **Create**. The **Chat** screen does the same across the
whole studio, and asks before it spends any time on your graphics card.

Both can use a **local model** on your own card (Qwen3 through ComfyUI) or an
**API model** you connect yourself (Claude, ChatGPT or any OpenAI-compatible
server). **✨ Enhance** under the Styles and Lyrics boxes uses the same choice,
set in **Settings → Enhance**. A local model waits while the card is busy with a
render; an API model never needs to.

## Why this rather than a cloud tool

<p align="center">
  <img src="GitHubAssets/AIPLAY_banner_3_no-account.png" alt="No account. No credits. No upload. Everything runs on your own graphics card." width="100%">
</p>

- **Nothing leaves your machine.** No account, no key, no credits. The only
  network use is downloading models (straight from their publishers), the
  Community screen, the hosted engine if you switch it on yourself, and the launcher's
  Use Comfy API mode, which sends your prompts and pictures to Comfy and the
  model's provider and spends your Comfy credits.
- **Every render is recorded.** The model, prompt, seed and settings behind
  each file go into a tamper-evident log *before* the render starts, so you can
  always tell what made a file. (Comfy API runs keep their own run list and
  raw answers, not this log.)
- **It checks before it spends.** A render that would fail is refused up front,
  with the reason, instead of after half an hour on your graphics card.
- **Licences are read, not guessed.** Each model shows what its licence says
  about the model and, separately, about what you make with it, so you know
  whether you can sell a song or picture before you render it.
- **An agent can drive all of it.** MCP tools cover the studio, so an
  assistant like Claude can run it while you watch.

The full reasoning is in [the deep dive](docs/DEEP_DIVE.md#why-this-rather-than-a-cloud-tool-in-full).

## NVIDIA, AMD, Intel or CPU

**No ComfyUI on this PC? Studio installs one.** The launcher asks what to run
on (**NVIDIA**, **AMD**, **Intel Arc** or **CPU only**, with your card marked)
and installs a private ComfyUI into `%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\engine`. It
never touches anything else on the PC, and an existing ComfyUI is never
modified. If a step fails, the partial install is removed and the launcher
shows you the exact error.

**Already have ComfyUI?** Studio finds it (portable, from source, or ComfyUI
Desktop) and launches it the way its own launcher does. It never installs or
replaces torch, CUDA or ROCm.

| your card | what works |
|---|---|
| **NVIDIA** | Everything. Use the portable `ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z` (not `_cu126`) or a source install with a `+cu130` torch. |
| **AMD Radeon** | Native YuE2 GGUF (Vulkan), YuE2, ACE-Step 1.5, MiniMax Music 3 and images through ComfyUI, Reactive, the DAW and compositor. MiniMax needs Studio's default launch flags (below). The 3D stack needs CUDA. |
| **Intel Arc** | Native YuE2 GGUF (Vulkan), and ComfyUI with an XPU torch. |
| **No GPU** | Native YuE2 GGUF on the CPU build, the DAW and the compositor. For video clips (here, or on any card too small for them), first ask a friend with a strong card to render them for you (**Collab**, free; built, not yet tried between two PCs). Then, paid on your own key: [the hosted engine](docs/DEEP_DIVE.md#no-gpu-api-mode) for MiniMax Music 3 songs, or the launcher's **Use Comfy API** mode. |

**Default ComfyUI launch flags:** `--use-pytorch-cross-attention --disable-cuda-graphs`.
They fixed MiniMax Music 3's broken audio on an RX 9060 XT, and they replace any other
attention flag your install uses (two attention flags stop ComfyUI starting). Change them
under **Advanced** in the launcher.

Measured AMD results, launch flags and the details of every layout are in
[the hardware section of the deep dive](docs/DEEP_DIVE.md#hardware-nvidia-amd-intel-and-cpu).

## Full Studio: your first song

For the whole suite (music, images, video and the rest):

1. Install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** (the LTS installer).
2. Have a **ComfyUI**, or let the launcher install one for you. See
   [Getting a ComfyUI](docs/DEEP_DIVE.md#getting-a-comfyui).
3. Double-click **`AIPLAY Studio.exe`** and choose **Full Studio**. It fetches
   its npm packages once and opens Studio in your browser.
4. Open **Models**. It reads your card and memory and suggests what is worth
   installing on *your* machine, with the size and licence of each: for music
   on a fresh install, YuE2 3B through ComfyUI (the 3.96 GB int8 build), or the
   native YuE2 GGUF Q4 on a small card or none. Nothing downloads until you
   press a button.
5. Open **Music**. It opens on **Simple**: choose one of the **Presets…** and
   press **Make song**, or press **Advanced**, write lyrics and a style, and
   press **Create**.

MiniMax Music 3 (11.9 GB) is still in the Models list for anyone who picks it.
On an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER a MiniMax song takes roughly real time: about four
and a half minutes for four and a half minutes of audio. A shorter lyric means
a shorter wait. Want a caption to start from? Try
[`examples/01-song`](examples/01-song/).

[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) has the complete walkthrough and troubleshooting.

## The models

Nothing downloads on its own. The **Models** screen reads your card and memory,
tells you what your machine can run, and fetches what you ask for, resuming if
the connection drops and checking every file when it arrives.

⚠ **terms unread** — **Ideogram 4 (open 9B)** — https://huggingface.co/ideogram-ai/ideogram-4-fp8/blob/main/LICENSE.md

The Ideogram Non-Commercial Model Agreement is behind a gate: the URL above returns HTTP 401 to an anonymous request (checked 2026-08-27) and no copy of the text has been read here. The name says non-commercial; every other non-commercial licence in this catalogue restricts the MODEL and leaves the output alone — but Ideogram's may not, and Studio will not guess in either direction. Accept the agreement on the model page, read §-by-§, and decide. If you need a settled answer today, FLUX.2 klein 4B is Apache-2.0.

**DWPose (TorchScript)** — https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DWPose/blob/main/LICENSE

Half of this capability is verified and half is not, and the unread half is the one that makes the skeleton, so the row answers with the weaker of the two. The detector (yolox_l.torchscript.pt) is Apache-2.0: Megvii's own LICENSE was diffed against the canonical text and every operative clause is identical. The estimator (dw-ll_ucoco_384_bs5.torchscript.pt) has no readable terms at all — its redistributor's entire model card is 28 bytes of frontmatter with no LICENSE file, and so is the card of the yzd-v/DWPose repository usually named as its origin. The Apache-2.0 licence linked above, IDEA-Research's, is reached only by a filename match, and a filename is not a grant. In practice a skeleton is a measurement of a video you supplied, and the clip it goes on to steer carries the RENDERING model's terms — WAN 2.1 VACE's, which are settled Apache-2.0 — so this is narrower than it sounds. Read the chain yourself before relying on the skeleton itself being licensed. Separately, and binding whoever trained the model rather than whoever runs it: DWPose was trained on COCO-WholeBody and UBody, which carry dataset terms of their own.

**pip, not a download** — Some capabilities are Python packages that fetch their own weights, so Studio has no file to verify and no button to press. They belong in a Python that is **not** ComfyUI's: installing them there can pull the torch build the engine depends on back down, which costs about 5× the speed of everything (INSTALL.md §5).

  · **MiniMax Music 3 DAV encoder** — `python -m pip install numpy torch av` (on top of the 306 MB of weights in the table)
  · **HTDemucs (fine-tuned)** — `python -m pip install demucs`
  · **TTS voices (Kokoro + Qwen3-TTS)** — kokoro + qwen-tts (sidecar venv at tts-venv/) — no single command; see the Models screen
  · **Whisper: transcription and timed lyrics** — `python -m pip install faster-whisper stable-ts`
    → Into Studio's own whisper venv, not the python on your PATH: `%USERPROFILE%\aiplay-whisper\venv` (or the python chosen in Settings > Songs > "timed lyrics python", or AIPLAY_WHISPER_PYTHON). With Python 3.11 or newer, in a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window (both open in your user folder): `python -m venv "aiplay-whisper\venv"`, then `aiplay-whisper\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126`, then `aiplay-whisper\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install faster-whisper stable-ts`. The torch line is for an NVIDIA card only. On Linux the venv's python is `aiplay-whisper/venv/bin/python`.

`node scripts/extras_setup.mjs` prints the exact command for your machine, aimed at the interpreter Studio will actually invoke, and says which are already installed.

**selling what you make** — Model licences and rights in generated material are separate questions. The catalogue records them separately. 19 of 49 are classified as placing no licence conditions on generated material (ACE-Step 1.5 turbo (ComfyUI), FLUX.2 klein 4B, Qwen3 4B, HTDemucs (fine-tuned), BiRefNet, TTS voices (Kokoro + Qwen3-TTS), Z-Image Turbo (Apache-2.0), Z-Image base (Apache-2.0), WAN 2.1 VACE 1.3B, Depth Anything V2 Small, AnimateDiff v3 (SD1.5), SparseCtrl RGB (AnimateDiff v3), IP-Adapter Plus (SD1.5), ViT-H/14 (LAION-2B), TripoSG 1.5B, UniRig, Whisper: transcription and timed lyrics, RIFE 4.26, Real-ESRGAN 2x). 21 say you may and attach conditions (MiniMax Music 3, YuE2 GGUF Q4 / optional Q8 (experimental), TaoMate 3-step LoRA (H3), video-to-video control (H3 Fun ControlNet), Fast setting for H3 (TaoMate 3-step, 182 MB), 4-step speed-up for H3 (1.96 GB), 8-step speed-up for H3 (1.96 GB), BUNNY (action logic), Semantic Bridge v1, YuE2 3B for ComfyUI (int8), YuE2 3B, MiniMax Music 3 DAV encoder, MiniMax H3 (quantised), FastH3 (8 steps, experimental), MiniMax H3 ref2va, Stable Audio 3 Small SFX, Krea 2 Turbo (community licence), Anima (non-commercial model, sellable pictures), LTX 2.5 (quantised), DreamShaper 8 (the Motion look's painter), depth and line art (SD1.5, fp16)). 7 are conservatively classified noncommercial / not for sale; that label does not resolve every output's legal status. 2 — Ideogram 4 (open 9B), DWPose (TorchScript) — nobody here has read. For MiniMax Music 3: §3.1 — a commercial product or service that uses it must show “MiniMax-Music3” prominently in its interface. That is why the name sits in Studio's corner rather than on a credits page. The operative sentence is quoted verbatim in `server/models.js` and shown on the Models screen before you download anything.

**shared files** — 7 files are used by more than one capability, so picking two of those costs less than adding their rows — up to 29.0 GB less. `qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3-int4_convrot.safetensors` (14.2 GB) is shared by MiniMax H3 (quantised), FastH3 (8 steps, experimental); `qwen_3_4b.safetensors` (8.0 GB) is shared by FLUX.2 klein 4B, Qwen3 4B, Z-Image Turbo (Apache-2.0), Z-Image base (Apache-2.0); `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors` (5.2 GB) is shared by MiniMax H3 (quantised), FastH3 (8 steps, experimental); `minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors` (605 MB) is shared by MiniMax H3 (quantised), FastH3 (8 steps, experimental); `flux2-vae.safetensors` (336 MB) is shared by FLUX.2 klein 4B, Ideogram 4 (open 9B); `ae.safetensors` (335 MB) is shared by Z-Image Turbo (Apache-2.0), Z-Image base (Apache-2.0); `qwen_image_vae.safetensors` (254 MB) is shared by Krea 2 Turbo (community licence), Anima (non-commercial model, sellable pictures). The Models screen quotes the deduplicated figure.

Studio hosts no weights and mirrors none: every download goes straight to the publisher, and the licence is between you and them.

## Drive it from an agent

Studio speaks MCP. Point an assistant at `node server/mcp.js` and it can make
songs, pictures, clips and whole music videos, edit a DAW project or a
compositor scene, and read the render log back. The **Agent** screen in the app
has the config block to paste. See [the tool list](docs/DEEP_DIVE.md#drive-it-from-an-agent)
and [API.md](API.md).

The [MCP workflow map](docs/MCP_WORKFLOWS.md) covers image references and masked
editing, Reactive timing/profiles, source-region training, and collaboration
planning, permissions and reviewed handoffs. Typed tools call the same API as the
page. `studio_api_reference` and `studio_api_request` cover existing JSON API
operations without a dedicated tool. Peer verification records the user's actual
word check; adding a capability does not grant trust or send files by itself.
Browser playback, OS dialogs and legacy canvas capture remain browser operations.

## What Studio will not make

Studio refuses any request that pairs a child or teenager with nudity or sexual
content: "This can't be made: it pairs a child or teenager with sexual
content." That holds for every model, screen, agent and setting, including
private and overnight renders, and nothing switches it off. Adult content stays
your choice. See [docs/SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md).

## Working on this repository

**Changing the interface? Read [docs/UI_GUIDE.md](docs/UI_GUIDE.md) first.**
Short labels, one-sentence hints, status as chips, the shared page kit, and
where new settings, tools and pages go. AI agents: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

**Run the gate before you push.** `sh .githooks/pre-commit` runs every test lane
in the repository (about six minutes). It is the same gate that guards a commit:
it checks the licences, the docs against the catalogue, and that every screen,
route and tool matches its other half.

```
sh .githooks/pre-commit        every lane, about six minutes
node scripts/trace_load.mjs    just the boot check, about a second
npm test                       the JavaScript suites
```

**Testing an install without touching your own.** Copy the repo
(`git ls-files -co --exclude-standard`), run `npm ci` in the copy, then start
`scripts/setup.mjs` and `launcher/launcher.mjs` with `AIPLAY_APPDATA` pointing at
an empty folder, different `AIPLAY_LAUNCHER_PORT` / `AIPLAY_UI_PORT`, and
`AIPLAY_LAUNCHER_NO_WINDOW=1`. Point `USERPROFILE`, `APPDATA` and `LOCALAPPDATA`
at empty folders too to simulate a PC with nothing installed.

**Three habits this codebase is built around:**

1. **Never claim more than you tested.** If an assertion does not cover a claim,
   say so in the same breath.
2. **When other code must know about something new** (a tool, a screen, an
   event, a test suite), add the check that fails when the two sides disagree,
   in the same commit.
3. **Build the file list from `git status`, not from your plan.**

The folder layout is described in [the deep dive](docs/DEEP_DIVE.md#layout).

## Known gaps

- **The ETA is noisy for the first ~30 seconds** of a render, then settles.
- **Rigging a 3D model cannot run on Windows yet.** It needs flash-attention,
  which has no Windows build. It refuses up front rather than pretending.
- **No Blender blockout has been scored through VACE yet.** The camera gate's
  0.924 motion agreement (against a time-shift null of 0.402) was measured on a
  synthetic corridor; a real stage set was watched, not scored.
- **Keeping a performer's identity across shots is unmeasured.**
- **The DAW's export-parity test compares no audio samples.** Parity holds by
  construction, but the regression that would break it is not covered.
- **Two model licences have not been read:** Ideogram 4's sits behind a login,
  and the DWPose estimator has no readable terms. Both rows say so and claim no
  rights.

The Suno-style Music screen, the one-click engine installer and AMD, Intel and
CPU support were merged from [bani4kaskashka's fork](https://github.com/bani4kaskashka).
Reactive is a re-creation of Yvann Barbot's idea (ComfyUI_Yvann-Nodes) on
Studio's own engine. The model authors and their licences are listed on the
Models screen and in [NOTICE](NOTICE).
