/**
 * VFX — the compositor tab.
 *
 * A compositor's four rooms, laid out the way every compositor lays them out:
 * a comp bar across the top, the layer stack on the left, the picture in the
 * middle, the selected layer's properties on the right, and time across the
 * bottom. Nothing here is invented — the point of copying After Effects's
 * arrangement is that someone who has used one already knows where to look.
 *
 * THE BROWSER NEVER RENDERS THE PICTURE. The viewer is an <img> pointed at
 * `/api/vfx/frame/:slug` — server pixels, the same pixels a render produces.
 * A canvas compositor here would preview one thing and export another, which is
 * the exact defect the Studio tab was built to avoid, and doing it twice would
 * be a choice rather than an accident.
 *
 * EVERY MUTATION GOES THROUGH `/api/vfx`. Not one field is written into the
 * document locally and saved later. That is what makes an agent and a person
 * interchangeable: the same action, typed here or called over MCP, produces
 * byte-identical documents. Drags are the one nuance — a drag paints from a
 * local copy while the pointer is down because a round trip per pointermove is
 * not a UI, and commits through the route on release.
 *
 * ── INTEGRATION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This module owns its whole interior, so index.html needs exactly ONE element:
 *
 *     <div id="vfx" hidden></div>          inside <section class="stage">
 *
 * plus the sheet in <head>:   <link rel="stylesheet" href="vfx.css">
 * and a rail entry:           <a href="#" data-view="vfx"><i>◈</i> VFX</a>
 *
 * Two exports, both safe to call more than once:
 *
 *     export function initVfx()        — once at boot; builds the DOM, wires
 *                                        listeners, fetches NOTHING.
 *     export async function vfxOpen()  — every time the tab is shown; loads the
 *                                        comp list, catalog and libraries.
 *
 * In `setView`, alongside the other views:
 *     $("vfx").hidden = name !== "vfx";
 *     if (name === "vfx") { initVfx(); vfxOpen(); }
 *
 * ── PATH CONVENTION (server owner: this is the one thing we have to agree on)
 * §6 gives `set_prop`/`add_key`/`remove_key` a `path` and one example,
 * `transform.position`. Effect params and mask params are animatable too (§1),
 * so they need paths as well. This UI sends DOTTED DOCUMENT PATHS RELATIVE TO
 * THE LAYER, where a segment landing on an array is matched BY `id`:
 *
 *     transform.position                 → layer.transform.position
 *     effects.fx_1.params.radius         → the effect with id "fx_1"
 *     masks.mk_1.feather                 → the mask with id "mk_1"
 *
 * Ids rather than indices, because reordering an effect must not silently
 * re-point a keyframed property at its neighbour.
 *
 * ── DEGRADING ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The engine is built by other people on other branches and may simply not be
 * there. Every fetch is caught; a failure paints one plain sentence saying the
 * engine is not responding, with a Retry, rather than a stack trace and a blank
 * tab. Empty states — no comps, a comp with no layers, a layer with no effects
 * — are first-class screens, not accidents.

 * That day came. The banner this replaces said the renderer did not run

 * one `ExprEnv` per rendered frame built at :325 and carried on the CompCtx, and
 * `interp.eval_prop(prop, t, default, ctx)` takes it as its fourth argument. The

 * coming out byte-identical) no longer reproduces: the same experiment now gives
 * two different frames.
 *
 * THAT DAY CAME TOO. The banner this replaces named its own deletion condition
 * — the day `camera.*` resolves — and it does: store.js's resolvePropPath has a
 * camera branch beside the light one, the enumerator returns six Camera rows,
 * and an expression on `camera.pointOfInterest` is what aims a lens at a moving
 * null. So the old sentence is now false in the direction that mattered most:
 * you CAN put an expression on a camera's lens.
 *
 * It is not deleted outright, because replacing it with silence would hide a
 * real asymmetry that is easy to trip over and fails QUIETLY. Writing an
 * expression on the lens works; READING one off another layer does not.
 * expressions.py's LayerRef exposes transform, effect, name, index, enabled and
 * the time fields — there is no camera branch — so `thisComp.layer("cam").zoom`
 * raises "layer has no 'zoom'" INTO THE ERROR LOG and the property quietly
 * falls back to the value underneath. Measured, not assumed: the same probe
 * reads `thisComp.layer("cam").position` as [100, 200, -500] and the `.zoom`
 * beside it as the fallback.

 * replace an entire track from an analysis. Snapshots handle all three without
 * knowing they exist.
 *
 * Restoring is ONE existing action — `set_comp` takes the whole layer stack
 * plus every comp-level field — so undo travels the same route as everything
 * else, is subject to the same validation, and needs nothing added to the
 * server. `migrate` passes an animated property through untouched, so a key's
 * `ease`, `to`, `ti` and `roving` survive the round trip byte for byte.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, said plainly rather than discovered later:
 *   · comp lifecycle — new, duplicate, delete. Those are files on disk, and a
 *     history that offers to un-delete a folder it did not keep is a lie.
 *   · undoing a `precompose` restores this comp's layers; the child comp it
 *     made stays on disk. [precomp-multisel] The panel HAS the button now —
 *     right-click a layer row → Pre-compose — and the whole gesture is one
 *     entry here because it travels through `mutate` like everything else;
 *     `histTo` says out loud that the child comp survives the undo.
 *
 * Cost, measured rather than assumed: the two comps on this machine are 4.3 KB
 * and 7.4 KB of JSON, so fifty steps is well under a megabyte. The case that
 * would not be is a track written by `audio_keys` — a three-minute song at 30
 * keys a second is 5400 keys on one property, six figures of JSON — and fifty
 * of those is tens of megabytes. That is survivable on a desktop and it is the
 * number to look at first if this tab ever starts feeling heavy.
 *
 * `runs` is dropped from the snapshot: it is the server's append-only audit
 * log, `set_comp` cannot write it, and it is the one field that only grows.

 * does — source = inPoint + (t − start) × timeScale — so trims, stretches and

 *
 * Peaks are cached per source+resolution and NEVER per comp: the server keys
 * its sidecar on (file, mtime, bins), so a comp edit re-DRAWS but never
 * re-decodes. Zoom picks a power-of-two bin count (one pair ≈ one pixel of

/* ── the graph editor ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The single largest gap between this tab and After Effects, measured against
 * the real thing: you could put keyframes down and retime them, and there was
 * no curve to shape. "Ease" as a dropdown of five names is not the same object
 * as a curve with handles — the dropdown can say easeInOut and cannot say
 * "leave slowly, arrive hard, overshoot by six percent", which is most of what
 * motion design consists of.
 *
 * THE CURVE DRAWN IS EVALUATED, NOT DESCRIBED. Every point on it comes from
 * `evalProp` — this file's mirror of `interp.py` — sampled across the comp. So
 * hold reads as a step, a bezier reads as its bezier, and an expression's
 * underlying keys read as themselves. Nothing here re-derives a shape from the
 * ease name, which is how a graph editor ends up drawing a curve the renderer
 * does not produce.
 *
 * WHAT IT WRITES, and why the shapes are copied off the server rather than
 * invented here (`store.js:normalizeKeys` is the authority, and this codebase
 * has been bitten repeatedly by a UI sending a spelling the server does not
 * read):
 *
 *   ease   `{ bezier: [x1, y1, x2, y2] }` — x1 and x2 pinned to 0..1 because
 *          normalizeEase refuses anything else (time cannot run backwards); y
 *          is free, which is exactly what makes overshoot expressible.
 *   to/ti  AE's spatial tangents, as OFFSETS from the key's own value and
 *          carrying the property's arity. Authored on the motion path below,
 *          not here — a spatial handle is a shape in the picture.
 *   roving `true` on an INTERIOR key only; the ends are the anchors it roves
 *          between, and normalizeKeys refuses a roving end.
 *
 * All three were already honoured by the interpolator and reachable from
 * nothing. That is the difference between machinery and a feature.
