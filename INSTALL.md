# Installing AIPLAY Studio

AIPLAY Studio writes and renders music on your own computer. No account, no
upload, no credits, no per-song cost.

## Start with YuE2 music only

**Same public repository, two launch modes—not a separate YuE2 edition.**
One launcher — `AIPLAY Studio.exe`, or `AIPLAY Studio.cmd` if you would rather
read the script — offers **Music only** and **Full Studio**, plus **Use Comfy
API** (cloud models on your own Comfy key; every run uses Comfy credits; no
ComfyUI needed, or `npm run start:cloud`). Downloading the app does not install
every AI model.

For native lyric-to-song generation, install **Studio** (Setup.exe brings
Node.js 20+ when this PC has none). You do **not** need ComfyUI, Python,
MiniMax or any image/video model.

1. Download and run **[AIPLAY Studio Setup.exe](https://github.com/Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio/releases/latest/download/AIPLAY.Studio.Setup.exe)**.
   Windows may say “Windows protected your PC” because the installer is not
   signed yet: click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. When it asks which
   build, choose **Senzu's**; then a folder (the default is right). It
   installs Studio plus, when this PC has no Node.js 20+, a private copy of
   it. No admin prompt. Section 3 says exactly what it does.
   *For developers:* install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), then download the
   source from [Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio](https://github.com/Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio)
   using **Code → Download ZIP**, or [download the ZIP directly](https://github.com/Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
   Unblock the ZIP in Windows Properties before extracting if Windows requires it.
2. Start **AIPLAY Studio** (the shortcut Setup made, or **`AIPLAY Studio.exe`** in the
   folder) and choose **Music only**. Or run these from the extracted source folder:

   ```text
   npm ci --omit=dev
   npm run start:music
   ```

3. In **Models → Review Q4 / Q8 setup**, explicitly install **YuE2 GGUF Q4**: about **2.93 GB** for the
   Q4 model, F16 VAE and four sidecars, plus **833 MB** for the native runtime.
   Read the licence/source notices and wait for verification to complete.
4. Open **Music**. A new install opens it on **Simple**: choose one of the
   **Presets…** and press **Make song**. For your own words, press
   **Advanced**, enter a style and nonempty lyrics, then press **Create**.

Keep the launcher window open. If another Studio is already running, wait for
its jobs to finish and close it before changing modes; both use port 4173 by default.

You can instead choose **Q8_0** in native setup: about **4.53 GB** of model files
plus the same runtime. Install either or both; shared files are reused. Select
Q4/Q8 on the Music page for each take. Q8 is higher precision, not a certified
audio-quality upgrade or a promise that it fits a particular GPU. Q4 stays default.

The native package targets Windows x64 on any card: CUDA on NVIDIA, audio.cpp's
official Vulkan build on AMD and Intel, its CPU build without a card. On NVIDIA
it also requires a current driver compatible with CUDA 13.3 and the
[Microsoft Visual C++ v14 x64 Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist),
installed separately from Microsoft if missing; the Vulkan and CPU builds carry
their own. A tested 16 GB GPU is
not a certified minimum; 6 GB and 8 GB cards have not been validated. Use the
[native guide](docs/YUE2_GGUF.md) for the single measured benchmark, CoT/NAR
controls, source pins, licences and troubleshooting. Model/runtime downloads
require your action; no Python packages are installed by this path.

## The full Studio installation

The rest of this guide describes the original, ComfyUI-backed full suite. Its
Python, MiniMax, memory-tier and video instructions are **not** requirements for
the native music-only launcher.

For those features, Studio is a face on [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).
Studio runs the interface and the queue; ComfyUI runs the models. You install
ComfyUI yourself. That split is deliberate — ComfyUI is gigabytes of Python
before a single model weight, and it updates on its own schedule.

The short way is two steps: **Setup.exe** installs Studio (and Node.js when the
PC has none), then the launcher installs the engine, ComfyUI and PyTorch, when
you answer *What should Studio run on?*; models come next, from the Models
screen. By hand, the install is three things, in order: **Node.js**, then
**ComfyUI**, then **Studio**. Perhaps twenty minutes of your attention, and then a long download
you can leave running. Once it is done, the first song takes about five minutes:
measured on a 16 GB RTX 4070 Ti SUPER, 0.07 s for the launcher's checks, ~15 s
for the engine to start, and 264 s to render 4 min 22 s of audio from the caption
in [`examples/01-song/`](examples/01-song/).

**If you want the short version, the README's quickstart is it.** This file is
the long version: every failure that has actually happened here, and what to do
about it. [`examples/`](examples/) has a worked input-and-output pair for each
kind of thing Studio makes — a song, a clip, a picture built from two other
pictures, and a music-video production bible — so you can see what a real request
looks like before you write one.

Everything here is Windows, because that is what this was built and measured on.
Other platforms are covered at the end, honestly.

## Before you start: full Studio / MiniMax

| You need | Why |
|---|---|
| **A graphics card for the music model Studio picks, or none.** YuE2 3B through ComfyUI (the build Studio recommends): an NVIDIA or AMD card, 8 GB of VRAM minimum, 12 GB recommended. The native YuE2 GGUF: any card (CUDA on NVIDIA, Vulkan on AMD and Intel) or the CPU, which is slow; Studio picks it with no card, on an Intel card, or on a PC under the ComfyUI build's card or RAM minimum. MiniMax Music 3, if you pick it: an NVIDIA or AMD card, 6 GB minimum, 12 GB recommended. | The ComfyUI music models' first stage needs a GPU device: CUDA on NVIDIA, or ROCm on AMD (a ROCm torch presents the card as `cuda:0`). There is no CPU fallback for them — MiniMax stops with `Expected a cuda device, but got: cpu`. Intel and Apple graphics will not run them. The AMD path is measured on one card — see [NVIDIA, AMD, Intel or CPU](README.md#nvidia-amd-intel-or-cpu). |
| **16 GB of system RAM**, 32 GB recommended. | On smaller cards the model is streamed out of system RAM, so RAM does the work VRAM cannot. |
| **Free disk space.** About 4 GB for music alone (YuE2 3B through ComfyUI, the build Studio recommends; MiniMax Music 3, if you pick it instead, is about 12 GB). About 64 GB more for music videos (MiniMax H3 and its reference build), and about 329 GB if you downloaded every model in the catalogue (a file two features share counted once). | The weights are large and they live inside your ComfyUI folder. Studio shows you the free space on that drive before any download. |
| **Node.js 20 or newer.** | Studio's server is written in it. |
| **A ComfyUI install.** | Studio drives one. It does not contain one. |

All the timings in this guide were measured on an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER (16 GB),
32 GB of RAM, Windows 11. Your numbers will differ; the ratios should not.

## 1. Install Node.js

Get the **LTS** installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). It is about
30 MB. Accept the defaults.

To check it worked, open a new Command Prompt and run:

```
node -v
```

You want `v20` or higher. Anything older and Studio will not start.

---

## 2. Install ComfyUI

**Easiest: let the launcher do it.** Start `AIPLAY Studio.exe`. If it finds no
ComfyUI it asks *What should Studio run on?* (NVIDIA / AMD / Intel Arc / CPU
only) and installs its own ComfyUI (v0.36.0, the version this Studio is tested
with) with the right PyTorch into `%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\engine`, plus
the Python packages Studio itself uses there (OpenCV, librosa and soundfile,
about 0.3 GB, and SciPy, which ComfyUI brings; if only those fail, the engine
is kept and the launcher's "Studio's own packages" row has **Try again**;
inside Studio, a feature that finds one missing names it, the python and the
pip line, and the setup that installs it into Studio's own engine). Nothing
outside Studio's folder changes: the
Python it fetches gets no ~/.local/bin copy and no registry entry. If the
install fails it removes the half-built engine, keeps what it downloaded so the
next try is quicker, and asks again with the exact error. Models come next,
from the Models screen. Skip to step 3 if you use it.

Or install ComfyUI yourself — Studio then drives the copy you already have and
never changes it.

### The easy route: the portable Windows build

Go to the [ComfyUI releases page](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest)
and download **`ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z`** — about **2.1 GB**
(2,146,721,943 bytes for v0.34.0, checked 2026-09-02; the size moves with each
release, the file name does not). It is a `.7z` archive — Windows 11 24H2 opens
those natively, and older Windows needs [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org).

⚠ **There are four NVIDIA-ish files on that page and one of them is a trap.**
Take the plain `_nvidia` build. `ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia_cu126.7z` is
there for machines with old drivers, and an old CUDA build is the single failure
in this whole stack that does not announce itself — section 5 below is entirely
about it. It costs about **4.9x the speed of everything**, prints one line into a
log nobody reads, and otherwise works perfectly. On an NVIDIA card the `_amd` and
`_intel` builds will not run the music model at all. On an AMD card the `_amd`
build is the one to take — see *AMD Radeon* below.

Extract it somewhere with room. `D:\AI\` is a good habit: model weights are tens
of gigabytes and land *inside* this folder, and the C: drive is rarely where you
want them.

**This build comes with its own Python and its own PyTorch.** You do not install
Python. You do not install CUDA. You do not touch a virtual environment. That is
the whole appeal, and it is why this is the route to take if you have never done
this before.

Then run it once, on its own, before you go near Studio. Double-click
`run_nvidia_gpu.bat`. Wait for it to open a browser tab. Close it again.

That is not ceremony, and it is worth knowing what it buys you. The first launch
is where the graphics card, the driver and PyTorch either agree with each other
or do not — and a disagreement there is far easier to read in ComfyUI's own
window than through Studio's engine log afterwards. Some layouts also only *have*
a Python environment after their first run, which is the next thing Studio goes
looking for.

**After that, Studio finds it unaided.** `scripts/setup.mjs` searches your home
folder, Documents, Desktop, AppData and every drive from C: to F: for `ComfyUI`,
`AI`, `AI\ComfyUI`, `ComfyUI_windows_portable` and `StabilityMatrix`, plus one
level inside each — so `D:\AI\anything\ComfyUI` is found too. Anything holding
`ComfyUI\main.py` counts. It then records both the folder and **which Python
layout you have** in `%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\settings.json`. You are asked
once, ever, and only when the search comes back empty or ambiguous. Measured on
this machine, that whole step costs 70 ms on every later launch.

> **Nothing extra for the portable build.** It keeps its Python at
> `<your-folder>\python_embeded\python.exe` rather than in a `venv`, and Studio
> finds either. Earlier versions hard-coded the `venv` layout, so the portable
> build — the route recommended right here — needed a hand edit to a source file
> before the engine would start. It does not any more: first-run setup detects
> the layout and records it. Set `AIPLAY_PYTHON` if you keep yours somewhere
> unusual.

### AMD Radeon: ComfyUI Desktop or the `_amd` build

Take **ComfyUI Desktop** and choose AMD when it asks, or the portable
**`ComfyUI_windows_portable_amd.7z`**. Both ship a ROCm torch. Run it once on its
own and render something, exactly as above — that is still the proof that the
card, the driver and torch agree.

Studio finds a Desktop install without being told. It reads
`%APPDATA%\Comfy Desktop\installations.json`, uses the venv at
`<install>\ComfyUI\.venv`, and copies that install's launch flags and model
paths into `settings.json`, so the weights stay where Desktop keeps them and
the engine starts the way Desktop starts it. Nothing is installed into that
venv; if you updated its torch yourself — a newer TheRock ROCm, say — Studio
uses what is there and only reads the version.

Close ComfyUI Desktop before starting Studio: Studio runs its own copy of that
same install, and two copies fight over the card.

### The other route: install ComfyUI from source

If you already run ComfyUI from a `git clone` with a `venv` beside it, you are
done — that is exactly the layout Studio expects, and no edit is needed. If you
are choosing between the two and you are comfortable in a terminal, this route
needs no patch:

```
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
```

Then create a `venv` inside the folder that *contains* `ComfyUI`, and install
PyTorch and ComfyUI's requirements into it, following ComfyUI's own README. The
result should look like this, and Studio will find it unaided:

```
D:\AI\my-comfy\ComfyUI\main.py
D:\AI\my-comfy\venv\Scripts\python.exe
```

## 3. Get Studio and start it

### The easy way: AIPLAY Studio Setup.exe

Download **[AIPLAY Studio Setup.exe](https://github.com/Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio/releases/latest/download/AIPLAY.Studio.Setup.exe)**, run it (Windows may say
“Windows protected your PC” because it is not signed yet: click **More info**,
then **Run anyway**), pick Senzu's build (the original, and the
default) or Bucky's, and press **Install**. It shows how far apart the two are
(ahead / behind) before you choose. It then:

- downloads that build's newest commit straight from GitHub, with no account;
- unpacks only what the repository's `install.json` lists, so no docs or notes;
- uses your Node.js 20+ if you have one. If you don't, it puts the official
  portable Node.js from nodejs.org into the install folder, checked against
  nodejs.org's SHA-256 list. There is no admin prompt, and nothing on the rest
  of the PC changes;
- fetches the three npm packages, adds Start menu and desktop shortcuts, and
  adds an Installed apps entry whose uninstaller asks before touching your songs.

**Updating** is the launcher's job: **Update**, beside Check for updates at the
bottom of the launcher, downloads the newest version of the build you installed
and replaces the app files (a git clone pulls instead). Studio has to be
stopped; songs, settings, models, your custom workflows and the private Node.js
are kept.

It installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\AIPLAY Studio` by default and can delete
itself when you close it. Running it again reinstalls in place and keeps your
data, which lives in `%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio`, never in the app folder.
It never touches ComfyUI, drivers or models: engine setup is the launcher's
system check, below.

The installer is built from `installer/Setup.cs` by
`node scripts/build-installer.mjs`. It knows two repository names and nothing
else about Studio, so it is rebuilt only when that file changes, never for an
app update.

### By hand

Download the repository from
[github.com/Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio](https://github.com/Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio)
— either the zip, or:

```
git clone https://github.com/Senzube4n/AIPLAY-Studio.git
```

If you downloaded a zip, **right-click it → Properties → Unblock** before
extracting. Windows marks downloaded archives, and that mark can stop the
launcher from running.

Then double-click **`AIPLAY Studio.exe`** and choose **Full Studio**.

The exe is a ~200-line wrapper (its source is `launcher/exe/AiplayLauncher.cs`)
that finds Node.js, fetches the npm packages if they are missing, and runs
`launcher/launcher.mjs` without a console window. It downloads nothing. If you
would rather read the thing you double-click, **`AIPLAY Studio.cmd`** beside it
does the same checks as a batch file you can open in Notepad, and most of what
you will read is comments explaining each one. Here is what that is.

1. **Checks for Node.js.** If it is missing, it says so and stops. Nothing else
   happens.
2. **Fetches npm dependencies** on first run. The four direct packages are:

   | Package | Licence | What it is for |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `ws` | MIT | WebSockets: following a ComfyUI job's progress, and the live panels in the app |
   | `three` | MIT | The 3D renderer, served to your browser from `node_modules` |
   | `gltf-validator` | Apache-2.0 (Khronos) | The official glTF validator used for uploaded avatars |
   | `@pixiv/three-vrm` | MIT (pixiv Inc.) | Local VRM avatars, expressions, MToon materials and spring bones |

   The VRM package also installs these thirteen transitive packages, all at
   version 3.5.5 under the MIT licence (copyright 2019-2026 pixiv Inc.):

   - `@pixiv/three-vrm-core`
   - `@pixiv/three-vrm-materials-hdr-emissive-multiplier`
   - `@pixiv/three-vrm-materials-mtoon`
   - `@pixiv/three-vrm-materials-v0compat`
   - `@pixiv/three-vrm-node-constraint`
   - `@pixiv/three-vrm-springbone`
   - `@pixiv/types-vrm-0.0`
   - `@pixiv/types-vrmc-materials-hdr-emissive-multiplier-1.0`
   - `@pixiv/types-vrmc-materials-mtoon-1.0`
   - `@pixiv/types-vrmc-node-constraint-1.0`
   - `@pixiv/types-vrmc-springbone-1.0`
   - `@pixiv/types-vrmc-springbone-extended-collider-1.0`
   - `@pixiv/types-vrmc-vrm-1.0`

   The server imports the glTF validator at startup; the VRM packages provide
   the browser's avatar runtime. Both launchers fetch missing direct packages.
   After updating an older copy, run `npm install --omit=dev` in the Studio
   folder to reconcile the complete dependency graph with `package-lock.json`.
3. **Finds your ComfyUI.** It looks in your home folder, Documents, Desktop, and
   on every drive from C: to F: for `ComfyUI`, `AI`, `AI\ComfyUI`,
   `ComfyUI_windows_portable` and `StabilityMatrix` — and one level inside each
   of those, so `D:\AI\anything\ComfyUI` is found too. Anything containing
   `ComfyUI\main.py` counts. If it finds one, it uses it. If it finds several, it
   asks. If it finds none, it asks you to paste a path, and it accepts either the
   `ComfyUI` folder itself or the folder above it.
4. **Starts the app** and opens your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`.

Leave the black window open. Closing it stops Studio.

Your answer to step 3 is saved to `%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\settings.json`,
so it is asked once, ever. Every later launch skips silently through the whole
sequence.

Behind the scenes, Studio now starts its own ComfyUI process on port **8266** and
keeps it running for as long as Studio is open. This is not a preference — one
long-lived process is what makes re-rolling a mix cost 15 seconds instead of 50.
Note that this is *your* ComfyUI, launched by Studio. Do not also run it yourself
at the same time: two copies will fight over the graphics card.

---

## 4. Get the models

Nothing downloads on its own. A first run must never begin with twelve gigabytes
of traffic you did not ask for.

Open the **Models** screen. Every capability is listed with its real byte count,
its licence, what it needs from your hardware, and one button. You choose what
you want and when.

<!-- MODELS:BEGIN -->
<!-- Generated by scripts/models_table.mjs from server/models.js. Do not edit by hand:
     the pre-commit hook fails if this block and the catalogue disagree. -->

Half of this capability is verified and half is not, and the unread half is the one that makes the skeleton, so the row answers with the weaker of the two. The detector (yolox_l.torchscript.pt) is Apache-2.0: Megvii's own LICENSE was diffed against the canonical text and every operative clause is identical. The estimator (dw-ll_ucoco_384_bs5.torchscript.pt) has no readable terms at all — its redistributor's entire model card is 28 bytes of frontmatter with no LICENSE file, and so is the card of the yzd-v/DWPose repository usually named as its origin. The Apache-2.0 licence linked above, IDEA-Research's, is reached only by a filename match, and a filename is not a grant. In practice a skeleton is a measurement of a video you supplied, and the clip it goes on to steer carries the RENDERING model's terms — WAN 2.1 VACE's, which are settled Apache-2.0 — so this is narrower than it sounds. Read the chain yourself before relying on the skeleton itself being licensed. Separately, and binding whoever trained the model rather than whoever runs it: DWPose was trained on COCO-WholeBody and UBody, which carry dataset terms of their own.

**pip, not a download** — Some capabilities are Python packages that fetch their own weights, so Studio has no file to verify and no button to press. They belong in a Python that is **not** ComfyUI's: installing them there can pull the torch build the engine depends on back down, which costs about 5× the speed of everything (INSTALL.md §5).

  · **MiniMax Music 3 DAV encoder** — `python -m pip install numpy torch av` (on top of the 306 MB of weights in the table)
  · **HTDemucs (fine-tuned)** — `python -m pip install demucs`
  · **TTS voices (Kokoro + Qwen3-TTS)** — kokoro + qwen-tts (sidecar venv at tts-venv/) — no single command; see the Models screen
  · **Whisper: transcription and timed lyrics** — `python -m pip install faster-whisper stable-ts`
    → Into Studio's own whisper venv, not the python on your PATH: `%USERPROFILE%\aiplay-whisper\venv` (or the python chosen in Settings > Songs > "timed lyrics python", or AIPLAY_WHISPER_PYTHON). With Python 3.11 or newer, in a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window (both open in your user folder): `python -m venv "aiplay-whisper\venv"`, then `aiplay-whisper\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126`, then `aiplay-whisper\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install faster-whisper stable-ts`. The torch line is for an NVIDIA card only. On Linux the venv's python is `aiplay-whisper/venv/bin/python`.

`node scripts/extras_setup.mjs` prints the exact command for your machine, aimed at the interpreter Studio will actually invoke, and says which are already installed.

**selling what you make** — Model licences and rights in generated material are separate questions. The catalogue records them separately. 19 of 49 are classified as placing no licence conditions on generated material (ACE-Step 1.5 turbo (ComfyUI), FLUX.2 klein 4B, Qwen3 4B, HTDemucs (fine-tuned), BiRefNet, TTS voices (Kokoro + Qwen3-TTS), Z-Image Turbo (Apache-2.0), Z-Image base (Apache-2.0), WAN 2.1 VACE 1.3B, Depth Anything V2 Small, AnimateDiff v3 (SD1.5), SparseCtrl RGB (AnimateDiff v3), IP-Adapter Plus (SD1.5), ViT-H/14 (LAION-2B), TripoSG 1.5B, UniRig, Whisper: transcription and timed lyrics, RIFE 4.26, Real-ESRGAN 2x). 21 say you may and attach conditions (MiniMax Music 3, YuE2 GGUF Q4 / optional Q8 (experimental), TaoMate 3-step LoRA (H3), video-to-video control (H3 Fun ControlNet), Fast setting for H3 (TaoMate 3-step, 182 MB), 4-step speed-up for H3 (1.96 GB), 8-step speed-up for H3 (1.96 GB), BUNNY (action logic), Semantic Bridge v1, YuE2 3B for ComfyUI (int8), YuE2 3B, MiniMax Music 3 DAV encoder, MiniMax H3 (quantised), FastH3 (8 steps, experimental), MiniMax H3 ref2va, Stable Audio 3 Small SFX, Krea 2 Turbo (community licence), Anima (non-commercial model, sellable pictures), LTX 2.5 (quantised), DreamShaper 8 (the Motion look's painter), depth and line art (SD1.5, fp16)). 7 are conservatively classified noncommercial / not for sale; that label does not resolve every output's legal status. 2 — Ideogram 4 (open 9B), DWPose (TorchScript) — nobody here has read. For MiniMax Music 3: §3.1 — a commercial product or service that uses it must show “MiniMax-Music3” prominently in its interface. That is why the name sits in Studio's corner rather than on a credits page. The operative sentence is quoted verbatim in `server/models.js` and shown on the Models screen before you download anything.

**shared files** — 7 files are used by more than one capability, so picking two of those costs less than adding their rows — up to 29.0 GB less. `qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3-int4_convrot.safetensors` (14.2 GB) is shared by MiniMax H3 (quantised), FastH3 (8 steps, experimental); `qwen_3_4b.safetensors` (8.0 GB) is shared by FLUX.2 klein 4B, Qwen3 4B, Z-Image Turbo (Apache-2.0), Z-Image base (Apache-2.0); `minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors` (5.2 GB) is shared by MiniMax H3 (quantised), FastH3 (8 steps, experimental); `minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors` (605 MB) is shared by MiniMax H3 (quantised), FastH3 (8 steps, experimental); `flux2-vae.safetensors` (336 MB) is shared by FLUX.2 klein 4B, Ideogram 4 (open 9B); `ae.safetensors` (335 MB) is shared by Z-Image Turbo (Apache-2.0), Z-Image base (Apache-2.0); `qwen_image_vae.safetensors` (254 MB) is shared by Krea 2 Turbo (community licence), Anima (non-commercial model, sellable pictures). The Models screen quotes the deduplicated figure.

Studio hosts no weights and mirrors none: every download goes straight to the publisher, and the licence is between you and them.
<!-- MODELS:END -->

Some things worth knowing before you click:

- **Downloads resume.** A dropped connection three quarters of the way through a
  12 GB file does not cost you the file. The partial is written as `.part` and
  only moved into place when the size matches to the byte, so an interrupted
  download can never leave a truncated file that looks finished.
- **Studio hosts nothing.** Every download goes straight to the publisher on
  HuggingFace. The licence is between you and them.
- **The MiniMax music weights are already the smallest published.** There is no "small
  model" to switch to. Fitting a smaller card is done by streaming, not by
  shrinking — see section 6.
- **You do not have to work out which rows apply to you.** The Models screen
  reads your card (`nvidia-smi` on NVIDIA; on AMD and Intel what Windows or the
  engine reports) and your system RAM, and puts one sentence at
  the top naming what to fetch for *that* machine, with the download size. On a
  16 GB card it says three models; on an 8 GB card it says two and explains, per
  row, why video is not among them. On a machine with no NVIDIA card it says so
  and refuses to recommend anything, rather than guessing.
- **Timed lyrics set themselves up.** Press **Set up timed lyrics** (Settings >
  Songs, or on the timed lyrics row of the Models screen). Studio builds a
  private Python 3.12 in `%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\venvs\lyrics` with the
  PyTorch that fits your card (CUDA 12.6 on NVIDIA, the CPU build otherwise;
  the choice beside the button changes it) and faster-whisper and stable-ts,
  checks both import, and only then makes it the timed lyrics python. The button
  says the download size before anything starts (roughly 2.6 GB on NVIDIA, an
  estimate); no system Python is needed. Already working, it installs nothing
  and says so. The manual lines in the table above still work if you prefer them.
- **The pip half has its own script.** Some capabilities need a Python package
  that Studio cannot fetch — two of them ARE the package rather than a file, and
  audio reference wants one on top of its weights. The table above names each
  one and the line to type. They must go in a Python that is **not** ComfyUI's;
  section 5 is why. Rather than working out which interpreter that is, run:

  ```
  node scripts/extras_setup.mjs
  ```

  It prints the exact command for each one with your own interpreter path
  already in it, read from the same `settings.json` that first-run setup wrote,
  and says which are already installed. It also prints the two LTX commands,
  which are the one case that *does* want ComfyUI's Python — that is where
  `huggingface_hub` lives.

  **Why audio reference is on that list at all.** Starting a render from a real
  song means encoding that song into the model's latent space, and ComfyUI will
  not do it — `comfy/sd.py` raises *"MiniMax Music3 DAV cannot encode audio"*.
  Studio does it outside ComfyUI with `scripts/dav_encode.py`, which is why it
  wants `numpy`, `torch` and `av` in the system Python. Everything after the
  encode is stock ComfyUI: the encoder writes an ordinary `.latent` file and
  ComfyUI's own `LoadLatent` reads it, so no custom nodes are involved at any
  point. If the packages are missing, the Models screen says so before you try
  to use it.

**Structural control needs two things that are not weights.** The Control card
on a storyboard steers a render with a real video (WAN 2.1 VACE), and neither of
these is downloadable from the Models screen:

- **ffprobe, for the gate.** A control clip must be exactly 1280x704, exactly
  24.000 fps and at least 121 frames, and all three fail *silently* — the wrong
  size is centre-cropped, a short clip is padded with flat grey, and the frame
  rate is never read at all. Studio measures the clip before it spends anything,
  and it ships without ffmpeg by promise, so **no ffprobe is an answer, not a
  crash**: the card refuses with a sentence saying the measurement could not be
  made. Put `ffprobe` on PATH, or point `AIPLAY_FFPROBE` at one. It never passes
  a clip it could not measure.
- **`comfyui_controlnet_aux`, for the two pose modes only.** The DWPose skeleton
  path needs that node pack (Apache-2.0) in your ComfyUI. The camera mode needs
  nothing beyond the VACE weights. ⚠ Installing ControlNet preprocessors is
  exactly the thing section 5 is about — some of them replace your PyTorch build
  and cost about 5× the speed of everything. Read that section first.

Models land in `<your-comfy-folder>\ComfyUI\models\` under `diffusion_models`,
`text_encoders`, `vae` and `loras` — ordinary ComfyUI locations. If you already
have any of these files, Studio finds them and does not download them again.

---

## 5. The one thing that can silently ruin this: your PyTorch build

Read this section even if everything is working. It is short.

> **On an AMD card this section's CUDA rule does not apply.** On a ROCm torch the
> fused kernels come from comfy_kitchen's `hip` backend, and the `cuda` line
> reading `'disabled': True` is normal — Studio counts either backend. Never
> reinstall torch from the cu130 index on an AMD machine.

**Normally you do not think about PyTorch or CUDA at all.** The portable ComfyUI
build ships a working Python and a working PyTorch, and that is the end of it.

But there is one failure that does not announce itself. The music model uses
fused int8 CUDA kernels. Those kernels need PyTorch built against **CUDA 13.0 or
newer**. On an older build — a `cu128` one, for instance — ComfyUI quietly
disables its fused backend, prints a single line into a log nobody reads, and
carries on working perfectly.

Just **4.9 times slower**. No error. No warning in the interface. A three-minute
song that should take five minutes takes twenty-four, and you conclude that this
is simply how fast local music generation is.

So Studio reads ComfyUI's startup output and checks for exactly this.

### What good looks like

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173/api/status` in your browser. You want:

```
"backend": { "ok": true, "torch": "2.13.0+cu130", "device": "cuda:0 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER" }
```

The parts that matter are `"ok": true` and a torch version ending in **`+cu130`**
or higher. In the app itself, good looks like the engine line reading
**RUNNING LOCALLY** with no red banner beneath it.

You can also read it straight from the engine log:

```
findstr /i "pytorch version" "%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\comfy.log"
```

And the kernels themselves:

```
findstr /i "comfy_kitchen" "%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\comfy.log"
```

A healthy line mentions `comfy_kitchen backend cuda` and says `'disabled': False`.
If it says `'disabled': True`, the fused kernels are off and you are on the slow
path.

### What bad looks like, and how to fix it

Studio shows a red banner: *"This install is running about 5× slower than it
should."* It names the torch version it found.

Update your NVIDIA driver first — a CUDA 13 build needs a recent one. Then
reinstall PyTorch into **the Python that ComfyUI uses**, not any other Python on
your machine. For a portable install:

```
D:\AI\ComfyUI_windows_portable\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
```

For a venv install:

```
D:\AI\my-comfy\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
```

Adjust the path to your own folder. It is a few gigabytes. Restart Studio
afterwards and check `/api/status` again.

### Why Studio uses three different Pythons

This looks like untidiness and is the opposite. ComfyUI's Python must stay on the
CUDA 13 build. If you let `pip` install `demucs` or `faster-whisper` in there,
their own requirements can quietly pull PyTorch back down to an older CUDA build,
and you get the slow app with no error and no obvious cause. So the engine keeps
its Python, and the extras use their own. Never `pip install` anything into
ComfyUI's environment unless you know it does not touch torch.

---

## 6. What can my machine run?

**The app answers this for your actual machine.** The Models screen reads your
card and your RAM and gives each of the seventeen capabilities one of four
verdicts — fits, runs slower by streaming, below the minimum, or "cannot tell"
when there is no NVIDIA card to read — with the reason in each case, and one line
at the top naming what to fetch. The table in this section is the coarse version
of the same arithmetic, kept because it is the shape of the answer rather than
the answer.

The full-suite MiniMax weights discussed here are already the smallest published versions. So the way
to fit a smaller card is not a smaller model — it is keeping less of the model in
VRAM and streaming the rest from system RAM. That is what the **graphics memory**
setting does. Studio picks a tier automatically; you can override it, and
changing it restarts the engine.

| Your VRAM | MiniMax music | Cover art | Stems | Timed lyrics | Video |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **6 GB** | Yes, slowly. Streams almost everything from RAM. ⚠ Unproven on real 6 GB hardware — it was simulated on a 16 GB card. Tell us how it goes. | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| **8 GB** | Yes. Roughly 2× slower than a large card. | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **12 GB** | Yes. Verified bit-identical output to the fast path. | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **16 GB+** | Yes, fastest. The model stays resident. | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

System RAM matters too: 16 GB minimum for music, 32 GB recommended, and 32 GB
minimum if you want video.

Nothing ever competes with music. Cover art, stems and lyrics run only when the
queue is empty, and a new song preempts them. Video and cover art are never
resident alongside the music engine on a 16 GB card, which is exactly why they
wait for idle time.

### What "fast" actually means, measured

| | On a 16 GB RTX 4070 Ti SUPER |
|---|---|
| Engine cold start | about 15 s |
| A fresh song | 39 s of audio in 65 s — **1.66× realtime** |
| Re-rolling the mix | **50 s → 15 s**, because the composition stage is cached |
| A cover | about 3 s |
| Stems for a 30 s track | about 12 s |
| Timed lyrics for a 2.5 minute song | about 36 s |
| A 5-second video clip, LTX 2.5 at 1280×704 | 121 s |
| The same clip, MiniMax H3 at 1344×768 | 308 s at 8 steps, 660 s at 20 |

## 7. When it goes wrong

Six things go wrong on a first run. These are all of them.

### "Node.js is not installed"

The launcher stops before doing anything else. Install the LTS build from
[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), then close and reopen the launcher — a
Command Prompt that was already open will not see the new install.

### It cannot find ComfyUI, or finds it and says there is no Python inside

If it says *"Found ComfyUI at ..., but no python environment inside it"*, run
ComfyUI once on its own first. That first launch is what creates the Python
environment; before it, there is nothing to find.

If it found nothing at all, paste the full path when it asks. Either the
`ComfyUI` folder or the folder above it is accepted. If the window closed too
fast to type into, write the path yourself into
`%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\settings.json`:

```
{ "rig": "D:\\AI\\my-comfy" }
```

Note the doubled backslashes — that file is JSON, and single backslashes make it
unreadable. `rig` is the folder that *contains* `ComfyUI`, not `ComfyUI` itself.

### The interface opens but the engine never becomes ready

The engine line stays on **STARTING…**, and after three minutes you get
*"ComfyUI did not become ready in time"*. In order of likelihood:

1. **You are running ComfyUI yourself at the same time.** Close it. Studio starts
   and owns its own copy on port 8266, and two of them fight over the card.
2. **Studio recorded a Python that is no longer there** — the ComfyUI folder was
   moved, or reinstalled into a different layout. Delete the `python` line from
   `%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\settings.json` and start Studio again; setup
   re-detects it. (Older versions hard-coded the `venv` layout and needed a hand
   edit to a source file on portable installs. That is fixed — first-run setup
   detects `python_embeded\python.exe` and `venv\Scripts\python.exe` alike — so
   if you are following an older guide that tells you to edit `config.js`, do
   not.)
3. **It is genuinely just slow.** The first load reads about 12 GB off disk. On a
   mechanical drive that can approach the three-minute limit.

The engine's own output is the truth here, and it is all in one file:

```
notepad "%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\comfy.log"
```

Read the last twenty lines. A Python that does not exist, a driver that is too
old, and a model file that is missing all say so plainly.

### A red banner says the install is 5× slower than it should be

Your PyTorch is too old for the model's fused kernels. This is covered in full in
section 5 — update the NVIDIA driver, then reinstall torch from the `cu130`
index into ComfyUI's own Python, then restart Studio.

Do not ignore this banner. It is the difference between the app being fast and
the app being pointless, and everything else will look normal.

### A render fails with an error about a missing model file

Two possibilities.

You have not downloaded that capability yet — open the **Models** screen and
check. Studio tries hard to catch this before you render, but a graph edited by
hand can still ask for something absent.

Or a download was interrupted and never completed. Studio checks every file
against its exact expected byte count, so a partial file reads as missing rather
than as broken — which is the correct behaviour but does look odd if you watched
the progress bar reach 90%. Press the download button again; it resumes from
where it stopped.

### Audio reference says the DAV encoder weights were not found

The message lists every folder it looked in. Usually it means the **Audio
reference** entry on the Models screen has not been downloaded yet — its size is
in the table in section 4, which is generated from the catalogue.

If you already have those weights somewhere — a HuggingFace cache left by another
tool, say — point at them instead of downloading a second copy:

```
set AIPLAY_DAV_ENCODER=D:\path\to\diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors
```

Studio checks your HuggingFace cache on its own too, honouring `HF_HOME` and
`HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE`, so a copy pulled by another tool is usually found
without you doing anything.

If instead the error mentions `av`, `numpy` or `torch`, it is the packages rather
than the weights — see the pip line in section 4.

---

## Optional: the audio-reactive page

Nothing above is affected by this, and you do not need to install anything for

**Cuts, Crossfade, Pulse, Film and Psychedelic need nothing extra.** They are
comps built out of ordinary layers and keyframes, rendered by `server/vfx` on
the CPU with numpy doing the pixels and ffmpeg muxing the song. They run on an
AMD card, or on no GPU at all.

**Paint and Motion are diffusion, and they need an NVIDIA card** and the engine
you installed above — not a second one. Motion additionally wants the SD1.5 and
AnimateDiff v3 weights, which sit in the Models screen with everything else and
download the same way; the page names what is missing rather than failing at
render time.

One trap worth knowing: installing the usual ControlNet preprocessors can
replace your PyTorch build, which costs about 5× the speed of everything — see
section 5. Studio's depth and line-art hints come from its own nodes and do not
need that pack.

## Other platforms

Studio is tested on Windows only, and it is honest to say the other platforms are
untested rather than unsupported.

**macOS is out.** Not a packaging problem — the music model's first stage
requires CUDA, and Apple silicon has none.

**Linux with an NVIDIA card should work**, with two edits. The launcher and its
exe are Windows-only, so run setup and the server yourself:

```
node scripts/setup.mjs
```

```
npm install --omit=dev && npm start
```

And `server/config.js` line 47 points at a Windows path. Change it to your venv's
actual Python:

```
  python: path.join(RIG, "venv", "bin", "python"),
```

Everything else — the model catalogue, the download logic, the backend check — is
platform-neutral. If you get it running, the project would like to hear about it.

## Where things live

| | |
|---|---|
| Your settings | `%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\settings.json` |
| The engine's log | `%USERPROFILE%\.aiplay-studio\comfy.log` |
| Finished songs | `<your-comfy-folder>\ComfyUI\output\` by default, changeable in Settings → Folders |
| Model weights | `<your-comfy-folder>\ComfyUI\models\` |
| The interface | `http://127.0.0.1:4173` |
| The engine | an unpublished loopback port Studio picks fresh at every start |

Folders and the interface port can be overridden with `AIPLAY_UI_PORT`,
`AIPLAY_RIG` and `AIPLAY_OUTPUT`.

**The engine's port is deliberately not a fixed number.** Studio binds ComfyUI to
a loopback port it chooses at each start and does not publish, so nothing else on
the machine can find it by guessing — which is what a second copy of Studio, or a
script with an old number baked into it, actually does. Every render then goes
through Studio's own door and is written down: the graph, the prompt, the seeds,
the model files, the wall time and the digest of every file produced. See
[docs/ENGINE_DOOR.md](docs/ENGINE_DOOR.md), and the **Engine** screen, which shows
the same record and can reveal the port when you genuinely need ComfyUI's own web
interface.

`AIPLAY_COMFY_PORT` still pins the engine to a fixed port, for an install that
already had to. It is a **compatibility path with a named cost**, not a
recommended setting: on a pinned port anything else on the machine can drive the
engine directly, and those renders will not appear in the ledger, the clip
library or any project. Studio says so in the log and on the Engine screen rather
than honouring it silently. Unset it to get an unpublished port back.

## One last thing

The four pipelines Studio actually submits are in
[`workflows/`](workflows/) as ordinary ComfyUI JSON. Drag one onto the ComfyUI
canvas and you can see and change every value in it.

Those values are not ComfyUI's defaults. They were arrived at by measurement, and
the scripts that measured them ship in `scripts/` so you can re-run them. That
tuning is most of what Studio knows, and it is yours the moment you open the
files.

Studio itself is Apache-2.0. The model weights are not — each carries its own
licence, stated on the Models screen before you download it.
