 * ALLOW-LIST, NOT DENY-LIST. This is the one decision in the file that matters.
 * The working tree contains 20-odd `dev_*.py` scripts that talk to AIPLAY's own
 * dev server, plus `dev-endpoint/`, which is platform code. None of it holds a
 * literal secret — credentials come from an external helper — but all of it
 * describes private infrastructure, and a deny-list would leak the next one
 * somebody writes. Anything not named below simply does not ship.
 *
 * The output is a zip, not an installer. Two reasons: an unsigned .exe that
 * wants to download 34 GB of model weights deserves more suspicion than it can
 * answer, and a zip can be read before it is run.
