/**
 * Restyle a video of any length, in chained segments.
 *
 *   node scripts/restyle_long.mjs --src <clip.mp4> --song <song.flac> [--segments 4]
 *
 * ONE LTX RUN IS 121 FRAMES — five seconds at 24fps. That is a property of the
 * model, not a setting, so anything longer has to be several runs stitched
 * together, and the whole difficulty is making the seam invisible.
 *
 * The join is made with the guide mechanism itself. Segment N+1 gets an extra
 * guide at frame 0 holding the LAST FRAME SEGMENT N PRODUCED — not the last
 * frame of the source — at a deliberately high strength. So each segment starts
 * from where the previous one actually ended, in the style it had actually
 * reached, and the paint carries across the cut instead of resetting.
 *
 * The audio window advances with the segments, so the bass drive follows the
 * song rather than replaying its first five seconds N times.
 *
 * Each segment lands in the clip library as its own clip. That is deliberate:
 * concatenation belongs to the timeline, which is what the timeline is for, and
 * MCP's build_music_video can lay them out. Pass --join to also write a single
 * assembled file for a docs asset — that path uses ffmpeg and is a BUILD step,
 * never something the app itself needs.

/* ── THE DOOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This harness no longer knows where ComfyUI is, because nothing does: the app
 * binds the engine to an unpublished loopback port chosen fresh at every start.
 * So the graph goes through AIPLAY Studio or it does not run — and if the app
 * is not up, the refusal below IS the enforcement.
 *
 * What that buys is the thing this script never had. Every arm now appears in
 * the ledger as script:restyle_long with its graph stored whole, its resolved
 * prompt, every seed and step count, the size, the model files, the wall time
 * and the digest of everything it wrote — and a FAILED arm is recorded too.
 * On the night this door was built, 424 files in the output folder had none of
 * that. See docs/ENGINE_DOOR.md.
