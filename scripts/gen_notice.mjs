/**
 * Regenerate the NOTICE file's model list from the catalogue.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS. That section is the one place a licence travels with
 * a FORK — somebody who clones this repo and never opens the app reads NOTICE
 * and nothing else. It was typed by hand, and by 2026-08-26 it had gone stale
 * in exactly the worst direction: it listed six models and omitted five,
 * including **Ideogram 4 — the single entry whose output terms nobody has been
 * able to read**, plus BiRefNet, RIFE, Real-ESRGAN and the DAV encoder. A
 * hand-kept list of licences is a list that is wrong the first time a model is
 * added, and a licence file that is wrong is worse than no licence file,
 * because it is believed.
 *
 * So the list is DERIVED, the way the Thanks page and the Models screen already
 * derive theirs: one catalogue, three surfaces, no fourth copy to forget.
 *
 *   node scripts/gen_notice.mjs           rewrite NOTICE in place
 *   node scripts/gen_notice.mjs --check   fail if NOTICE has drifted (pre-commit)
 *
 * Only the model-weights section is touched. Everything a human wrote —
 * the vendor attribution, the runtime dependencies — is left exactly alone.

declares its files in server/models.js and downloads them from the publisher, at
the user's request, on their own machine. Those weights carry their own licences,
which are shown in the app before anything is downloaded and are between the user
and the publisher.

This list is GENERATED from that catalogue by scripts/gen_notice.mjs — a
hand-kept second copy is a copy that goes stale, and it did. Re-run it after
adding a capability; the pre-commit hook checks it has been run.

"Output rights" answers one question: may the person who generated something
sell it? Four answers only — yours (nothing in the licence touches the output),
yours with conditions (the licence says so and attaches terms), not for sale
(Studio's conservative noncommercial classification, not a determination that
all generated material is governed by the weights' licence), and unverified (nobody has read
the operative text — stated as ignorance, never dressed up as either verdict).
The operative sentence itself is quoted verbatim in server/models.js and shown
in the app.`;
