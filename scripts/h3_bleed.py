"""h3_bleed.py — measure how much of a reference image is showing through.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `h3_score.py` measures psnr_ref, loop_db, flicker and audio_rms.
None of them detect reference bleed: every one compares a clip against a
CONVERGED RUN OF ITSELF, so a clip that faithfully reproduces the reference on
every frame scores perfectly. The bleed complaint had no instrument behind it.

WHAT IT MEASURES, and why the shape matters more than the number.

  ncc[t]  normalised cross-correlation between output frame t and the reference,
          on mean-removed luma at a common analysis size. Scale-free and
          brightness-free, so a clip that merely shares the reference's exposure
          does not score.

The CURVE is the diagnosis, not the mean, because the two mechanisms in
docs/H3_REFERENCE_BLEED.md produce different curves:

  DECAYING from frame 0   -> reference-COPY. The last reference sits 1.000 RoPE
                             time-units from frame 0 while frame 1 sits 1.667
                             away, so a copy head has its strongest pull at the
                             start and it washes out.
  FLAT across the clip    -> posterior-mean COLLAPSE. At 4 steps the committed
                             x0 comes from sigma 0.800 and the reference is the
                             only clean signal in the attention window, so it
                             biases every frame equally.

  band    the fraction of total NCC contribution falling in the central vertical
          third of the frame. `_frame_grid` area-normalises around centre 16.0,
          so mechanism (1) predicts the ghost lands as a TALL NARROW BAND THROUGH
          THE VERTICAL CENTRE. A band score well above 1/3 is that signature.

THE CONTROL YOU MUST NOT SKIP. An NCC of 0.4 means nothing on its own — a rap
video and its own character reference share a person, a palette and a framing.
So every run also scores the clip against a MISMATCHED reference: one belonging
to a different clip. Bleed is (matched - mismatched), not matched. Without that
baseline every number here flatters itself.

Usage:
  h3_bleed.py --clip <mp4> --refs <png> [<png> ...] [--control <png>]
  h3_bleed.py --ledger            # score recent reference-conditioned H3 clips

    768x1344 reference into a 320x176 landscape frame destroys a correlation the
    eye picks up instantly: on mv_bone-waffle-cgi_s1_4_mtgkjbnr the first three
    output frames are visibly that reference, yet stretched-NCC scored it at
    0.044 and picked a different reference as the frame-0 owner.

    Fitting is also what the pipeline does. `ref_image_size: "match"`
    (workflow.js:1404) scales a reference to the generation's pixel AREA while
    PRESERVING ASPECT, so the model never sees a stretched reference either.
    Measuring against a stretched one measures something the model was never
