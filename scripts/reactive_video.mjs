/**
 * Audio-reactive iterative img2img — the Deforum-lineage feedback renderer.
 *
 *   node scripts/reactive_video.mjs --src <dir> --song <file.flac> [options]
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A FILTER.
 *
 * Each output frame is generated FROM THE PREVIOUS OUTPUT, not from scratch:
 *
 *     base_N  = blend( zoom(out_{N-1}), src_N, srcWeight )
 *     out_N   = colourMatch( img2img(base_N, denoise_N), anchor )
 *
 * That single line of feedback is the whole trick. The previous output carries
 * the accumulated style forward, so the paint builds up and drifts the way paint
 * does; the source frame is mixed back in every frame, so the dancer's pose and
 * motion keep being re-imposed and never wash away. Neither half works alone —
 * measured on this machine, one img2img pass at denoise 0.75 destroys the figure
 * completely, while 0.50 barely touches it. There is no single denoise that both
 * restyles and preserves. The chain is what makes it possible.
 *
 * WHAT THE MUSIC DRIVES. `denoise_N` and the zoom, from the bass envelope that
 * `beats.py` already measures. Measured on the reference clip this was built to
 * match: how heavily restyled a frame is correlates with the bass at r = +0.378
 * (detrended, against 0.239 for the best time-shifted control) and with onset
 * transients at only +0.126. So it is the CONTINUOUS band envelope that belongs
 * on denoise, not the beat grid. Driving it from peaks gives a flicker; driving
 * it from the envelope gives the slow breathing morph.
 *
 * ⚠ Everything here is core ComfyUI — VAEEncode, SplitSigmasDenoise, ImageBlend,
 * ImageScale/ImageCrop, ColorTransfer. No custom node pack, so no licence
 * question and nothing to install.

 * second checkpoint — encode a picture, hand it to the conditioning.
 *
 * MEASURED, same source frame and seed, four ways: text alone at denoise 0.5
 * barely moves the picture; the reference alone barely moves it; reference plus
 * text tints it; reference plus text at denoise 0.69 produces the figure made of
 * flowing paint that all six earlier runs failed to reach.
 *
 * 🔑 And it raises the ceiling. Without a reference, denoise 0.75 destroys the
