/**
 * API mode — generate music through a hosted MiniMax Music 3 instead of a GPU.
 *
 * WHY. The local engine needs 16 GB of VRAM, a ComfyUI install and ~12 GB of
 * weights. That rules out most laptops. The rest of Studio — the library, the
 * covers, the timeline editor, karaoke, overnight batching — has nothing to do
 * with a GPU, and it is the majority of the app. API mode lets someone use all
 * of that on hardware that could never run the model, and moves to the local
 * engine later with the same library and the same files.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS YOU, HONESTLY. Two things, and both are in the UI rather than
 * buried here:
 *
 *  1. MONEY. The local engine costs electricity. This one bills per second of
 *     output. Overnight runs are Studio's best feature and would be its worst
 *     bill — twenty ideas at three takes of three minutes is around twenty
 *     dollars. Hence the ledger and the hard cap below, which are not optional
 *     polish; without them someone queues 200 songs and finds out afterwards.
 *
 *  2. AUDIO REFERENCE. Gone. Studio's most distinctive feature encodes a real
 *     recording into the model's own latent and partially denoises it. Every
 *     hosted endpoint is text-in, audio-out — no latent input, no denoise. This
 *     is not an oversight to route around; it is the shape of the API. The UI
 *     disables the control and says why rather than failing at submit time.
 *
 * KEYS. Never stored here and never held in this module longer than a request.
 * They live DPAPI-encrypted via server/secrets.js and are read per call. Studio
 * talks to the provider DIRECTLY from the user's machine — nothing is proxied
 * through any AIPLAY server, so the transaction is between the user and the
 * provider they chose, and there is no place in the middle for keys to pool.
