   * `systemPython` above (torch 2.5.1+cu121, where demucs and ctranslate2 live).
   * `server/mesh/` needs a THIRD, and the reason is a hard version collision

   * diffusers, and the interpreter this app's engine runs on is pinned at
   * diffusers 0.7.0.dev0. `pip install diffusers` into a running engine's
   * environment does not fail — it succeeds, and the next song render fails,
   * hours later, in a place that says nothing about a mesh.
   *
   * So: its OWN venv, spawned as a subprocess, never imported. Nothing in this
   * tree may add a package to either of the other two on its behalf. And then a
   * FOURTH, `unirigPython` below, for the same reason one step further out: the
   * rig needs a different Python VERSION, not merely different packages. All of
   * these paths are OPTIONAL — every capability that uses them degrades to a
   * sentence saying which file is missing, exactly as `blender` above does.
   *
   * Licence note, for contrast with the block above: this one is NOT a licence
   * boundary. TripoSG and UniRig are MIT for code AND weights, which is why they
   * were chosen, so `server/mesh/mesh_cli.py` is an ordinary file in this
   * Apache-2.0 tree. The subprocess here is about python versions and nothing

   * engine's python does not fail; it succeeds, it moves torch, and the next
   * song render dies hours later inside a kernel in a place that says nothing
   * about YuE2. Same argument as `mesh` above, one engine along. Six of YuE2's
   * eight pins collide with the engine's, two across a major version.
   *
   * The two model paths are here only so they are overridable in ONE place;
   * their defaults are identical to models.js's YUE() helper, which is where the

   *
   * 🔴 MEASURED ON THIS CARD, and the operating rules that came out of it:
   *   167.0 s of 48 kHz 24-bit audio in 399.6 s from a SUPPLIED score, peak
   *   ~10.5 GiB. 163.9 s in 473.5 s on a first pass with offloadAr on.
   *   The ceiling is 13.99 GiB and it CANNOT be raised: the pipeline computes
   *   min((budget-2)*GiB, total-2*GiB), so 2 GiB is reserved whatever you pass,
   *   and a 12 GiB card therefore gets a 10 GiB cap that does NOT fit.
   *   FIVE OOMs traced to one cause: a one-step render lets the model choose
   *   its own length and then allocates for it. Both halves fit separately —
   *   planning alone peaked ~8.9 GiB — so `twoStep` splits it, and the second
   *   half costs ZERO score tokens because the score is then supplied.
   *   Each render needs a FRESH PROCESS: a held pipeline OOM'd on the same
   *   score and seed that finished in a clean one, because fragmentation
   *   belongs to the CUDA context and outlives empty_cache().

   * WHICH MUSIC ENGINE RENDERS A SONG.
   *
   * Music had no engine concept until now — MiniMax's settings were flat
   * siblings (`models`, `sampling`, `speed`), which is fine for one engine and
   * wrong for two. The shape here follows `video.engines` below, and the same
   * rule applies: every engine-specific value lives under `engines`, and
   * nothing sits beside it except the switch a user thinks of as "which model".
   *
   * ⚠ `runtime` is the axis video does not need and music does. The two engines
   * do not merely differ in weights, they run in DIFFERENT PROCESSES:
   *   "comfy"  — the long-lived ComfyUI engine. Keeps a warm AR cache, which is
   *              worth a great deal: MEASURED 258 s -> 0.3 s on an identical
   *              re-run, 246 s -> 130 s on a settings-only change.
   *   "python" — a subprocess on its own interpreter (`config.yue`), a fresh one
   *              per render. No warm cache, so a re-roll costs full price.
   * A third, "audiocpp", is where the published GGUF builds would go: a native
   * binary, which the arithmetic says is ~8.9x this machine's Python path at
   * BF16 (RTF 0.27 against a MEASURED 2.39) with nothing quantised, and ~8.3 GiB
   * instead of 12.5 at Q8_0 — so quantisation there buys HARDWARE REACH rather
   * than speed. It is deliberately NOT listed as an engine yet: nothing has been
   * built, installed or heard on this machine, and an engine that appears in a
   * dropdown and cannot render is the exact defect `mesh`'s comment above was
   * written about. It becomes a data change here, not an architecture change,
   * once it has been measured.
   *
   * Adding an engine needs BOTH a row here and a MODEL_TO_CAPABILITY line in

     * 🔴 TWO CORRECTIONS TO WHAT THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY, both found by reading
     * the code rather than by a new measurement.
     *
     * FIRST, IT WAS READ BY NOTHING. This key has been `true` since the engine
     * landed and no code consumed it: `renderSong()` did not take the option,
     * yue_driver.py had no argument for it, and pipeline.py:124 defaults
     * `offload_ar=False`. So every song rendered before 2026-09-11 ran with the
     * flag OFF while this file said otherwise. Now wired: yue.js reads it as
     * the default for `renderSong({ offloadAr })`, which forwards --offload-ar.
     * A setting nothing consumes is worse than a missing one, because it is
     * believed — including by whoever wrote the sentence below it.
     *
     * SECOND, THE SPEED FIGURE WAS NOT MEASURING THIS. It said "2.89x realtime
     * with it against 2.39x without". Given the above, the 2.89x run had the
     * flag off, and its own note at config.js:306 calls it "a first pass" — so
     * it measured a cold start, not a lever. The cost of this flag is UNMEASURED
     * and the ladder in server/music/yue_fit.js records it as null rather than
     * carrying the old number forward.
     *
     * ⚠ AND IT DOES NOT RAISE THE DURATION CEILING, which is the reason it is
     * kept at `true` as a stability setting and not offered as a way to get a
     * longer song. nar.py:249 constructs CachedNAR — whose __init__ ends in
     * _prefill() at nar.py:127, allocating the whole length-dependent K/V cache
     * with all 6.7627 GiB of weights resident — BEFORE nar.py:251 enters the
     * offload context. The stage's peak is already set by then. What the flag
     * buys is 4.0344 GiB of headroom across the 64 velocity evaluations that
     * follow, which is most of the wall clock. */

     * This said "ltx" and it was the only defect in the install path that could
     * not be worked around by reading more carefully. LTX 2.5 is the better
     * engine on the numbers directly above — and its repository is ACCESS-GATED.
     * The built-in downloader refuses it on purpose (see `gated` on videoLtx in
     * models.js: it has no token and deliberately nowhere to keep one), so the
     * Models screen offers instructions where every other row offers a button.
     *
     * Which meant the shipped default pointed at the single model a new user
     * could not obtain. Open the Video page on a fresh install and it said "LTX
     * 2.5 is not downloaded yet (39.7 GB missing). Open the Models screen." —
     * and the Models screen had nothing to press. First click, dead end,
     * out of the box.
     *
     * So the default is now the fetchable engine. This costs an existing user
     * nothing: a saved `video.engine` in settings.json overrides it (PREF_PATHS
     * below), and anyone already holding LTX weights keeps rendering on them
     * because resolveVideoEngine() in workflow.js resolves to WHAT IS ON DISK,
     * preferring the setting. The default is only ever the answer for a machine
     * that has neither — and for that machine, H3 is the only true answer.

     * ⚠ H3 carries a TERRITORY condition (no rights in the EU, the UK, the

     * 12.0 default, 4/4 on two metrics" was noise being read as signal by a
     * design with no noise floor in it.
     *
     * Confirmed by eye: the contact sheets for shift 4 and shift 12 are both
     * clean — coherent face, readable knit texture, stable lamp, smooth push-in
     * — and shift 12 scored the LOWEST `detail` while looking fine, which is one
     * more reminder that high-frequency energy is not quality.
     *
     * 4.0 is KEPT, but only because every render on this machine was made with
     * it and there is no reason to churn. It is not better. If anything here
     * matters for quality it is the two rows above this one: native resolution
     * with a trained length, and actually loading the LoRA.

     * 🔴 SUPERSEDED 2026-08-24 — 12.0, the model's own default, after diffing
     * our graph against the vendor's template flows and A/B-ing what they do
     * differently. The vendor runs NO sigma-shift node (so the model default,
     * 12/3, applies) and NO turbo LoRA at 20 steps. Reconciling every
     * measurement on file:
     *
     *   - The BARE model needs shift 12 — its own schedule. "LoRA off = the
     *     face is a smear" (08-18) was measured at shift 4; at shift 12 the
     *     bare model at 20 steps was the cleanest arm on both seeds tried.
     *   - The LoRA path tolerates any shift (the 08-18 resweep: spread smaller
     *     than seed noise on every metric) — distillation bakes its own
     *     schedule in, so 12 costs the fast path nothing.
     *   - Temporal churn (mean inter-frame |diff|, two seeds): LoRA@20+shift4
     *     1.35/0.95 vs bare@20+shift12 0.67/0.30 — the shipped combo flickers
     *     2-3x more, which IS the long-standing "jittery" report.
     *
     * So: 12 unconditionally, and the LoRA only below `turboMaxSteps`.

 * The Models screen fetches the fl2v 4-step 768p (its "video" row) and the
 * ref2v 4-step v0.1 ("videoRefs") and no 8-step file, so on a machine set up
 * from that screen `turboLora` and `refTurboLora` fall back to 4-step files.
 * A literal 8 there ran a 4-step distillation at 8 steps on every render that
 * named no step count, the move the turboLora4 comment calls "a different one
 * used wrongly". So each number is what this disk can run matched:
 *
 *   standard  8 where pick() resolved BOTH turboLora and refTurboLora to an
 *             8-step file, else 4, the matched 4-step setting. Never the
 *             bare model by default: 20 costs 2.4x the time (arm H vs C).
 *   fast      3 where a TaoMate 3-step file resolved, else 4 where both
 *             4-step slots did, else the same as standard (one chip then,
 *             not two that do the same thing).
 *   best      20, the bare model, which no LoRA file gates.
 *
 * `steps` is standard. /api/status sends stepDefaults and turboBuilds, and
 * the Video screen's slider and chips and make_clip's `quality` read them
 * there rather than keeping a literal. Resolved once, at import, like pick()
 * itself: a file downloaded later loads after a restart, and so does the
 * default that matches it. A file's step count is read off its name
