/**
 * Overnight batch runs.
 *
 * You write a handful of ideas, say how many takes you want of each, and go to
 * bed. In the morning the library is full.
 *
 * Three decisions carry this file:
 *
 * 1. ROUND ROBIN, not sequential. The plan is take 1 of every idea, then take 2
 *    of every idea, and so on. A run that only gets 60% through overnight then
 *    leaves you with a few takes of everything rather than twenty takes of idea
 *    one and nothing at all of ideas four through six. Partial completion is the
 *    normal case for an unattended run, so it is what the ordering optimises for.
 *
 * 2. THE PLAN IS ON DISK. An overnight run outlives crashes, engine restarts and
 *    accidental window-closing, so the plan and the cursor are persisted on every
 *    transition and reloaded at boot. Closing the browser was already harmless --
 *    the queue lives here, not in the page -- but losing power at 3am was not.
 *
 * 3. ONE JOB IN FLIGHT. The runner enqueues the next song only when the previous
 *    one lands. Queueing all fifty up front would make Stop mean "stop in about
 *    four hours", and would freeze every ETA in the UI.
 *
 * Every take gets a fresh performance seed, so takes differ as real alternates
 * rather than as remixes of one performance. See workflow.js for why the seed and
 * the mix seed are separate knobs.
