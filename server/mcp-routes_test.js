/**
 * THE DOOR CENSUS — every MCP tool posts to a route that exists, and names an
 * action that route actually handles.
 *
 * ── the failure this exists for ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `score_render` shipped posting `{ action: "render" }` to /api/score. That
 * route dispatches sixteen actions and `render` has never been one of them —
 * `git log -p --follow server/score/routes.js` shows no `case "render"` in
 * either commit the file has. So the tool answered
 *
 *   {"error":"Unknown action. Try: list, create, read, adopt, draft, note,
 *    author, current, map, invariants, lineage, sheet, capability, delete,
 *    to_daw, export_midi."}
 *
 * for every input anyone could give it, for its whole existence, while sitting
 * in the catalogue advertising a measured GPU cost. It was not the first:
 * server/score/routes.js:451 carries a comment about `draft`, found the same
 * way on 2026-09-11, and says plainly that "188 assertions passed, because the
 * suite checks what the tool would SEND, not what happens when it arrives".
 *
 * Every existing tool-surface lane checks the tool against ITSELF — that a
 * declared parameter reaches run() (mcp-image_test.js, mcp-daw_test.js,
 * mcp-vfx_test.js), that a description does not name a phantom tool
 * (mcp-guide_test.js). None of them looks at the other end of the wire. This
 * one does, and only that: does the door exist, and does it know the word.
 *
 * ── what it can and cannot see ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is a STATIC read of `String(tool.run)` plus the server source. It cannot
 * run the server and it cannot follow a path computed at run time. So it counts
 * what it managed to analyse, counts what it did not, and prints BOTH — a lane
 * that quietly covers two thirds while reading like it covers all of them is
 * the same lie it was written to catch. A tool it cannot analyse must be named
 * in UNREADABLE below with a reason; the run is FAILED otherwise, so "not got
 * round to" cannot hide inside "not analysable".
 *
 * It resolves three layers of indirection, because the codebase uses all three:
 *
 *   1. a module's own one-line POST wrapper (`const score = async (body) =>
 *      api("POST", "/api/score", body)`), and helpers that call one;
 *   2. a wrapper handed to a sub-module's factory (`...rackTools({ daw, get,
 *      slugOf })`), followed through the import;
 *   3. a run() re-wrapped after the fact — mcp-vfx.js replaces every slug-bear-
 *      ing tool's run with a revision-scoped closure and parks the original on
 *      `run.unwrappedRun`, which it added for exactly this kind of audit.
 *
 * And on the route side, it follows the delegating mounts: server/daw/routes.js
 * hands `action` to voicelab.js and refprofile.js before its own switch, so
 * their cases are the door's cases too.
 *
 * Runs standalone (`node server/mcp-routes_test.js`) and in the pre-commit
 * hook. No server, no GPU, no python.
