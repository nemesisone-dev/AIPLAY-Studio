/**
 * KEEP MY CHARACTER: the REWIND A/B's recommended setup, built into the
 * screens (2026-09-24, DIRECTING.md §2).
 *
 * Four shots at the same seeds: with 1-3 tight pictures of the lead, the
 * reference build at its own 8 steps, res_multistep and the song under the
 * clip, the lead matched in all four; from words alone his hair, mask and coat
 * changed between clips. This lane holds the pieces that make that the easy
 * choice:
 *
 *   1. the sampler     res_multistep on the reference path under "auto"; the
 *                      fl2v turbo builds keep Euler; an explicit one wins.
 *   2. the steps       referenceSteps: the reference file's own count, one
 *                      answer for the status, the plan and the music video.
 *   3. the plan        video-plain.js videoPlan binds a saved character, runs
 *                      the reference count when none is named, and says what
 *                      the render keeps (`character`) in its own words: the
 *                      measured setup is a constant (a 4-step-only disk is
 *                      said to run an unmeasured one), pictures the words
 *                      never name are said, and Song under the clip's words
 *                      follow the engine (no lip-sync promised on LTX).
 *   4. the door        /api/video resolves the character BEFORE the safety
 *                      check, so the check sees its pictures and its words,
 *                      and stages them with the request's own resolver (a
 *                      character saved from uploads rides; run for real).
 *   5. the page        the Keep my character row, shown in Simple, its words
 *                      the server's; the Fast chip's while a character is kept.
 *   6. make_clip       `persona`, and the rule in its description.
 *
 * No server, no engine: the plan runs for real, the page's lines are lifted
 * and run with only the names they read, make_clip runs against a mocked door.
