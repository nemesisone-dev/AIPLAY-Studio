/**
 * ComfyUI supervisor — ONE long-lived process for the lifetime of the app.
 *
 * This is the single most important architectural decision in the product, and the
 * easiest to lose in a refactor. ComfyUI caches node outputs within a process, and
 * the expensive autoregressive stage depends only on (caption, lyrics, seed,
 * max_duration, cfg, top_k). Change nothing but the sampler settings and that stage
 * is reused: measured 246 s -> 130 s, with the AR stage reporting 0.0 s.
 *
 * An identical re-run short-circuits entirely: 258 s -> 0.3 s.
 *
 * Restart per job and all of that is thrown away, the app becomes ~40% slower on
 * every re-roll, and nothing in the UI explains why.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE NO LONGER DOES ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It used to be a supervisor AND half an engine client: `get base()`,
 * `submit()`, `interrupt()`, and four bare `fetch()` calls. That second job has
 * moved WHOLE to `server/engine/client.js`, and this file now contains no
 * `fetch(` at all — asserted by `server/engine/ui_test.js`, because a
 * supervisor that can also post a prompt is a second door however carefully it
 * is written.
 *
 * What it kept is everything that is actually about a child process: the
 * lifecycle, the tier flags, the startup-log sniffing that catches a 4.9x
 * regression, the crash backoff, and BOTH halves of the adoption guard. Those
 * were each written after a measured incident and none of them moved.
 *
 * The one visible change: THE PORT IS NO LONGER A CONSTANT. It is reserved from
 * the OS at every start (including the crash-restart path and setTier), so two
 * Studios on one machine cannot collide at all, and a script cannot bake the
 * number in — which is the whole point, since fifteen scripts across two repos
 * had 8266 copied into them. `AIPLAY_COMFY_PORT` still pins it, loudly.
