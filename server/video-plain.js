/**
 * THE VIDEO SCREEN IN PLAIN WORDS, AND THE ONE PLAN BEHIND A RENDER.
 *
 * One copy of every sentence the Video screen and make_clip say about a clip
 * before and after it renders, and the one function that decides what a
 * render request becomes (videoPlan). /api/video's `create` renders the plan,
 * its `check` returns it without rendering (the Video screen's Advanced line
 * and make_clip's `check_only` read that), /api/status serves the per-engine
 * sentences, and art.js turns an engine failure into a sentence here. The page
 * shows these words; it never writes its own.
 *
 *   refsIgnored       an engine that takes no reference pictures (FastH3, LTX):
 *                     a clip with any attached is REFUSED, never rendered
 *                     without them (UI_PLAN E4). The reference slots and
 *                     make_clip say the same sentence.
 *   tags              a <Picture n> / <Audio n> the render cannot resolve is
 *                     taken out of the description and said, never sent to the
 *                     engine as plain words.
 *   matched steps     the Fast setting with references runs the reference
 *                     build's own count (workflow.js h3MatchedSteps), and says
 *                     so.
 *   start size        a render that names no size on a smaller card gets the
 *                     card's tier size (h3tier.js h3StartSize), and says so.
 *   frames on FastH3  accepted, and said to be untried (the lab ran FastH3 on
 *                     text only).
 *   not offered       H3 on a card it is not offered on: said, never refused
 *                     silently or rendered silently (the page asks first).
 *   fit, RAM          "this size needs about X GB free; you have Y" and the RAM
 *                     warning, from h3tier.js.
 *   failures          ComfyUI's error JSON becomes a sentence; the raw text
 *                     stays behind Details.
 *   keeping a         the REWIND A/B (2026-09-24, DIRECTING.md §2): a person
 *   character         stays the same from clip to clip with 1-3 pictures of
 *                     them, the reference build's own step count and, for a
 *                     singer, the song under the clip. `character` says what
 *                     a render keeps (the Video screen's Keep my character
 *                     line and receipt, make_clip's reply); a saved character
 *                     (persona) is bound into the words here; a render with
 *                     references that names no step count runs the reference
 *                     build's own (workflow.js referenceSteps); the `runs`
 *                     note names the build, steps, sampler and decoder. The
 *                     measured setup is a constant (KEEP_MEASURED), apart
 *                     from what this disk can run, so a 4-step-only disk is
 *                     said to run an unmeasured setup; Song under the clip's
 *                     words follow the engine (songUnderSay: lip-sync on H3,
 *                     measured not to follow on LTX).
 *
 * Imports only data and pure helpers; no I/O.
