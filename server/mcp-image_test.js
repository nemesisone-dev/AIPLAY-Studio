/**
 * Every parameter an mcp.js tool ADVERTISES actually reaches its run().
 *
 * The same guard mcp-vfx_test.js runs over the VFX tools, extended to the
 * main tool list — because the same bug shipped here too: a schema property
 * added without its run() forwarding it validates, returns 200, and silently
 * does nothing. `additionalProperties: false` means a client trusts the
 * schema, so a schema that lies is a feature that appears to work.
 *
 * The check is a heuristic: it reads each tool's run source and asks whether
 * the parameter's name appears in it. That cannot prove the value is used
 * correctly, but it catches "declared and dropped", which is the class that
 * has actually happened. A tool that forwards its whole argument object is
 * listed in IGNORED, with the reason written down.
 *
 * Plus the structural checks for the routes the image panels lean on — the
 * same source-reading style vfx/routes_test.js uses, because these run on
 * every commit and must not need a server or a python.
