/**
 * DOES THIS MACHINE RUN IT — the gate on the answer.
 *
 * Every claim this suite makes is about a machine that is not the one running
 * it. That is the point. The rig this app is developed on is a 16 GB RTX 4070
 * Ti SUPER with 32 GB of RAM and every model already downloaded — which is
 * precisely the machine on which a hardware recommendation cannot be wrong in
 * any way you would notice. The people it can be wrong for are on an 8 GB card,
 * or on a MacBook, or on a fresh disk, and none of them are here.
 *
 * So `fitFor` and `recommendFor` take a machine-shaped OBJECT rather than
 * calling gpuStatus() themselves, and this suite hands them three:
 *
 *   1. THIS RIG            16 GB card, 32 GB RAM — everything runs, H3 at full size.
 *   2. AN 8 GB CARD        16 GB RAM — H3 is offered at its smaller size (960x544,
 *                          5 s) with the RAM warning, and NOT recommended: the lab
 *                          measured the size, but only ever with 32 GB of RAM.
 *   3. NO NVIDIA CARD      nvidia-smi returns nothing. "Cannot tell", never "no".
 *   4. A 4 GB CARD         under every H3 tier — no video at all, and it has to say so.
 *   5. THE H3 EDGES        an 8 GB card with 32 GB of RAM (recommended at the smaller
 *                          size), 8 GB of RAM (under the floor), a 6 GB card (the
 *                          unproven preview), an AMD card, no card with 16 GB.
 *
 * The capabilities are built from the real CATALOG with every file marked
 * ABSENT, because the interesting reader is the one who has just installed and
 * downloaded nothing. Nothing here touches the disk, the GPU or the network.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST is `never recommends a model Studio cannot
 * download`. The shipped default video engine was LTX 2.5 for months, and LTX
 * 2.5 is access-gated — so a fresh install's first click on the Video page hit
 * "not downloaded yet, open the Models screen", where there is no button for
 * it. Every check in the GATED section exists so that cannot be reintroduced by
 * an edit that looks entirely reasonable.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Runs standalone (`node server/fit_test.js`) and in the pre-commit hook.
