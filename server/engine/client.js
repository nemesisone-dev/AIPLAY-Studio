/**
 * THE ENGINE DOOR — the only file in this tree that knows where ComfyUI is.
 *
 * ── THE MEASUREMENT THIS EXISTS FOR ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On 2026-09-02 the rig's output folder held 426 files written since noon the
 * previous day. 424 of them had no ledger entry of any kind: gate/ 135, film/
 * 70, vace/ 40, previz/ 34, mv/ 31, ressweep/ 15 — and 85 in `clips/`, which
 * the app ALREADY LISTS in its library and can say nothing whatsoever about.
 * No model, no prompt, no seed, no size, no elapsed time, no actor.
 *
 * They were not lost. They were rendered by three scripts in the other repo
 * that POST straight to `http://127.0.0.1:8266/prompt` — a constant copied into
 * fifteen more scripts here — write into this app's output folder, and never
 * open its ledger. The library was not missing the files; it was missing the
 * RECORD.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE DOES ABOUT IT ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. The port is EPHEMERAL. `reservePort()` binds :0 on loopback, reads the
 *    number the OS gave it, closes, and hands that to the supervisor for
 *    `--port`. A fresh one at every start, including crash-restart and tier
 *    change. A constant is a thing a script bakes in; a number that is
 *    different every run cannot be copied, and that is the only property that
 *    actually removes the temptation. It also makes the collision the owner has
 *    hit twice impossible rather than merely caught.
 *
 * 2. `base` is module-private and is NEVER exported, returned by a route, or
 *    logged. Everything else in the app calls the functions below.
 *
 * 3. `dispatch()` writes the record BEFORE it touches the engine, and a ledger
 *    failure costs the render. That inversion is the whole design — see the
 *    warning at the append itself.
 *
 * ── THE RESIDUAL, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * ComfyUI ships no authentication of any kind: no token, no password, nothing
 * to configure. `--listen 127.0.0.1` means nothing OFF this machine can reach
 * it — real, and unchanged. But ON this machine, `Get-NetTCPConnection` finds
 * the port in one command and a curl to it renders. An unpublished port does
 * not change that; what it changes is that nothing can find it by GUESSING,
 * and guessing is exactly what a second copy of this app, a stale script with
 * 8266 baked in, or a person following an old note actually does.
 *
 * So this is a boundary against ACCIDENT and against our own code drifting,
 * not against a determined local process. The adversary is me, at 2 a.m., with
 * a script from the other repo — and against that adversary an unpublished port
 * plus a build-failing bypass census is decisive. Enforcement would need a
 * token-checking proxy (which on one machine just moves the obscurity down a
 * layer, since our own client must carry the token in a readable file) or an
 * OS rule scoped to a process (Windows Firewall does not filter loopback).
 * Neither is worth it today; both are named so nobody has to rediscover that.

   * once by index in this file, once at runtime with a ledger that throws:
   *
   *   1. validate the graph, and say which of the two ComfyUI save formats
   *      this is when it is the wrong one
   *      …and refuse sexual content involving minors (server/safety), filing
   *      only a wordless `refused` event: nothing below runs for such a graph
   *   2. build the record — pure
   *   3. store the graph under its own hash
   *   4. AWAIT the delegate event, AND LET A THROW ABORT
   *   5. POST /prompt
   *   6. poll to a terminal state, every wait bounded
   *   7. hash the outputs
   *   8. AWAIT the generate event
   *
   * ⚠ STEP 4 IS THE ONE PLACE IN THIS APPLICATION WHERE A LEDGER FAILURE MUST
   * COST THE RENDER. Everywhere else the bargain is the opposite — provenance.js
   * tells its callers to `.catch()` because a ledger failure must never cost the
   * media. Here the media IS the thing being recorded, and "nothing runs
   * unrecorded" is the entire design. There is no `.catch()` on that line and

   * nor /queue (runs mto5iphvf293e7 and mto5ngyxf4893c): it wrote no output,
   * and its ledger row said `vanished` — the status this door reserves for "a
   * ComfyUI restart discarded it". Nothing had restarted. Stop was two engine-
   * wide calls: `interrupt()`, which is addressed at nothing in particular and
   * stops whatever the GPU is holding, and `clearQueue()`, whose `{clear:true}`
   * wipes the WHOLE pending list. Every other actor's work went with the song,
   * and the record then blamed the engine for it.
   *
   * So a cancel is addressed at a PROMPT. Two ways, in order:
   *
   *   1. `POST /api/jobs/<promptId>/cancel` — this engine's own per-job cancel,
   *      which dequeues a pending prompt and, for a running one, calls
   *      `interrupt_if_running(prompt_id)` UNDER THE QUEUE MUTEX. That
   *      atomicity is worth reaching for rather than reimplementing: it is the
   *      one thing a client cannot do, because between our own "is it running?"
   *      and our own POST /interrupt the prompt can finish and the NEXT one —
   *      somebody else's — can start, and the interrupt lands on that instead.
   *      Exactly the bug being fixed, one layer down.
   *
   *   2. Older engines have no such route, so: `{delete:[id]}`, which ComfyUI
   *      applies to the PENDING list only and therefore cannot touch what is
   *      rendering — ours or anyone's — and then `interrupt()` ONLY if a fresh
   *      read of /queue says the thing rendering is this very prompt. The read
   *      is taken AFTER the delete on purpose; a queue that cannot be read at
   *      all is UNKNOWN, never "running", and no interrupt is sent, because
   *      guessing here spends somebody else's half hour.
   *
   * A run with no prompt id — API mode, or cancelled in the gap between the
   * ledger append and the POST — reaches the engine NOT AT ALL. There is
   * nothing of its own to stop, and the only thing an interrupt could stop then
   * belongs to somebody else.
