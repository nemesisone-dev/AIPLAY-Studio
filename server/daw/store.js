/**
 * DAW — the project store. P0-1 of the DAW plan (daw_research REPORT §7/§14).
 *
 * One JSON document per project:
 *   <outputDir>/daw/<slug>/project.json
 *   <outputDir>/daw/<slug>/cache/        rendered bar-region audio, disposable
 *
 * SINGLE WRITER, the same discipline as server/vfx/store.js and for the same
 * reason: HTTP routes, MCP tools and a render that finishes at some arbitrary
 * moment all write here. Every mutation goes through one promise chain per
 * slug and lands via write-temp-then-rename, and updatedAt bumps MONOTONICALLY
 * (the frame-cache lesson: Date.now() has millisecond resolution, and a stale
 * region served for a fresh edit is the worst failure this subsystem has).
 *
 * ── TIME IS MUSICAL, §12 of the report — the day-one requirement ──────────
 *
 * Meter and tempo are FIRST-CLASS EVENT LISTS on the project; a bar is a
 * DERIVED object. Nothing in this file, the routes, or the MCP tools assumes
 * bars are equal length or four beats. Seconds exist only at the render
 * boundary (regionsOf / posToSeconds, called when a job is built).
 *
 *   meterMap: [{ atBar: 1, num: 4, den: 4 }, { atBar: 17, num: 7, den: 8 }]
 *   tempoMap: [{ atBar: 1, bpm: 120 }]           bpm is QUARTER-NOTE bpm
 *
 * A position is `{ bar, beat, tick }`: bar and beat 1-based, tick 0..959.
 * TICKS_PER_BEAT = 960 where a BEAT is the meter's DENOMINATOR unit — a
 * quarter in 4/4, an eighth in 7/8 — so `bar 3, beat 2` always names what a
 * musician counting the bar would call "two", and a 7/8 bar has exactly 7
 * beats of 960 ticks. Tempo, by contrast, is pinned to the QUARTER NOTE (the
 * MIDI SMF convention): 120 bpm means quarters last 500 ms in every meter, so
 * a 4/4→7/8 change does not silently halve the pulse. The two conventions
 * meet in one line: a beat in x/den lasts (4/den) quarters.
 *
 * Durations (`durTicks`) are in ticks of the LOCAL beat unit and are walked
 * through the meter map bar by bar, so a note that crosses a meter change is
 * exactly as long as the bars it crosses say it is.
 *
 * ── A CLIP IS THE CONTAINER THAT DECIDES WHAT SOUNDS (agent/dawparity) ────
 *
 * `fromBar`/`toBar` are not decoration. A note whose bar falls outside its
 * clip's range is STORED and SILENT: noteEvents skips it, so it leaves every
 * region hash, and widening the clip again brings it back unchanged. That is
 * what makes shrinking a clip non-destructive (the Ableton bargain: hidden,
 * not deleted) and what makes a resize a real edit the dirty-region diff can
 * see. Moving a clip moves its notes with it — see shiftClipNotes.
 *
 * ── DIRTY REGIONS ARE CONTENT HASHES ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The render is chunked into fixed REGION_BARS-bar regions. Each region's
 * identity is a sha1 over everything that can reach its samples: the region's
 * absolute sample window, and every note whose SOUNDING interval — start to
 * end-plus-instrument-tail — intersects it, with the note's absolute sample
 * placement, pitch, velocity, instrument, track gain and seed. An edit in bar
 * 9 changes only the hashes of the regions bar 9's sound can reach; every
 * other region keeps its hash and therefore its cache file. There is no
 * separate "mark dirty" bookkeeping to drift out of sync with the truth —
 * the hash IS the dirty bit, and diffing hashes before/after a mutation is
 * how the routes answer "what did this edit touch".

 * auditions and gets comped, but never renders into the mix.
 *
 * AUDIBILITY IS THE NOTES' OWN TEST, and it has to be: `track.mute` alone was
 * right only while clips could not reach the rack at all. A solo forces the
 * chain path (isDefaultMixer refuses a soloed document), so the moment the
 * chain stage learned to mix clips, a clip on a NON-soloed track would have
 * sounded straight through a solo — the fix for one silence writing a
 * different one. mixerAudible composes solo with mute in the one place
 * noteEvents already reads it.
 *
 * AND SO IS REACH, for the same reason and on the same day. A clip's own
 * samples were the whole truth only while its sound could not cross a device.
 * rack._mix_audio now mixes the clip into the track's DRY buffer, so it
 * crosses that track's inserts, and clause 2 of THE DEPENDENCY-GRAPH RULE
 * (mixer.js's header) governs it exactly as it governs a note: through a
 * STATEFUL device the reach is [start − 0.02 s, ∞). Measured on the tree
 * before this line existed: a one-second take at 6 s, through a tempo-synced
 * delay into a reverb, put −26.2 dBFS of tail into the NEXT region — a region
 * that neither hashed the clip (so no clip edit could ever invalidate its
 * cached wav) nor was sent it (so `bounce`, which concatenates those wavs,
 * stepped 0.002510 at the seam where the correct render steps 0.000039). One
 * silence traded for a click and a cache that cannot be told it is wrong.
 *
 * A MEMORYLESS path — and every default mixer — gets { back: 0, fwd: 0 }, so
 * reach0 === startSec and reach1 === endSec and nothing below can move: the
 * P0 region hashes are byte-identical, proven by hand in capture_test.js.

/**
 * [DAWREC] The clips that reach one window, in the ENGINE JOB's own shape —
 * and the only place a document clip becomes an engine clip.
 *
 * There were three copies of this mapping (the region render in routes.js,
 * the stems in voicelab.js, and the meters job that had none at all), which
 * is three chances for one lane to carry a field the others do not.
 * `track_id` is exactly such a field: rack.chain_graph needs it to know whose
 * dry buffer the samples belong in, and a clip without it lands in the
 * unnamed bus. It rides on every clip, chained or not — the P0 mono path has
 * one bus and ignores the key, and a job that means the same thing in both
 * lanes is worth more than a key saved.
 *
 * THE WINDOW TEST IS REACH, character for character the one routes.js applies
 * to notes (`e.reach0 < t1 && e.reach1 > t0`). A clip whose delay tail rings
 * into this window has to be IN this window's job or the graph cannot produce
 * the tail: rack.chain_graph renders from absolute sample 0, so a clip placed
 * before the window still lands at its true position and its state arrives
 * where it belongs. On the P0 mono lane engine.mix_clips intersects the clip
 * against the window and a clip that ends before it contributes nothing — and
 * a default mixer never widens the filter anyway, so that lane cannot move.
