/**
 * AIPLAY Studio — MCP server.
 *
 * Lets an agent drive the whole studio: write a song, draw pictures, render
 * clips, read the beat grid off the finished audio, and assemble a music video
 * cut to it. Everything here is a thin, typed face on the HTTP API the app
 * already serves, so there is exactly one implementation of each behaviour and
 * the UI and an agent cannot drift apart.
 *
 *   node server/mcp.js            # speaks MCP over stdin/stdout
 *
 * Point it at a running Studio with AIPLAY_URL (default http://127.0.0.1:4173).
 *
 * The stdio transport uses Node's built-in HTTP/JSON support. Tools call the
 * Studio API and preserve agent provenance. VFX renders can export video on
 * the server; the legacy Studio canvas export remains browser-based.
