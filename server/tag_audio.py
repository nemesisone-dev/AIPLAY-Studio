"""Stamp a generated file with its provenance, and report its true duration.

Two jobs, one pass over the file:

1. METADATA — required, not optional. Two tiers (SPEC.md D3.1):

   TIER 1 — the machine-readable AI marker (DIGITALSOURCETYPE, AI_DISCLOSURE,
   GENERATOR, TOOL, GENERATED_BY, AI_GENERATED). PINNED: there is no key in the
   meta file, no flag, and no code path that suppresses it. Two independent
   grounds, each sufficient: the MiniMax-Music3 Community Licence's
   acceptable-use policy requires machine-generated content to be disclosed,
   and EU AI Act Article 50(2) puts the marking duty on the tool's provider —
   the studio marks so its users never have to think about it.

   TIER 2 — the rich record (prompt, lyrics, seeds, sampling params, origin
   map, ledger chain head). The user's own working record, governed by the
   `tier2` field in the meta file (Settings → "Embed detailed provenance in
   exports"). Off means those keys are simply not written; the marker stays.

   Deliberately recorded: the MODEL made it, and every setting needed to reproduce
   it. Deliberately NOT recorded: any claim that AIPLAY made it — the user made it,
   on their own machine. We are the tool, not the author.

2. DURATION — the library shows how long each track is, and the only honest source
   is the file. Returned here so the scan does not need a second decode.

Usage: tag_audio.py <file.flac> <meta.json>

Metadata comes from a FILE, not argv — lyrics contain newlines and quotes, and
shell quoting mangles them (it did, on the first attempt).

⚠ Note ComfyUI already writes its entire workflow graph into a `prompt` field on
every output. That means the raw lyrics and every node setting are ALREADY in the
file before we touch it. Ours are the human-readable, standard-key versions that
players and taggers actually display.
