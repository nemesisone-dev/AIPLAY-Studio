 * One action-dispatched POST plus five GETs, the shape /api/mv already uses, so
 * this is one insert into the route table rather than twenty-five.
 *
 * EVERY capability here is reachable from MCP too (server/mcp-vfx.js), and both
 * surfaces call THESE routes. That is the rule that stops the agent path and the
 * GUI path drifting apart — the failure this app has been bitten by before is a
 * feature that works from one surface and silently does nothing from the other.
 *
 * SOURCES ARE LIBRARY NAMES. A layer's `src` is "raven.png", never a path, and
 * it is resolved to an absolute path only in the last breath before the comp is
 * handed to python. A client that could name a path could name any file on the
 * disk, and this server answers to a browser tab and to an agent.
 *
 * Dependencies are injected rather than imported so this file stays additive —
 * index.js owns the paths and the runners.

 * 3.8 fps and no amount of renderer tuning turns that into 30. The fix is not a
 * faster render, it is not rendering: pre-render the work area, hold the frames,
 * play them back.
 *
 * Two tiers, because they fail differently. The disk tier survives a restart and
 * is the one that already existed. The RAM tier is bytes — the disk hit is still
 * a stat, an open, a read and a stream, and at 30 fps the player asks for one
 * every 33 ms; holding the PNG collapses that to a single socket write.
 *
 * Both caps are env-settable because the right number is a property of the comp,
 * not of the app: 1080p text frames run ~300 KB, a photographic plate ten times
 * that. The caps are REPORTED in the manifest — a cache that quietly holds less

  /**
   * One long-lived `engine.py serve` child answering frame and probe jobs over
   * stdin — `{"id":…, "cmd":…, "job":{…}}` a line in, one JSON line back — so
   * the ~400 ms of interpreter + numpy/PIL/cv2/PyAV startup is paid once per
   * session instead of once per frame. Measured on this box before the change:
   * 425 ms wall per cold 320×200 preview frame, of which 28 ms was compositing.
   *
   * ONE CHILD, ONE FIFO QUEUE — not a pool. The decision, so nobody re-decides
   * it blind:
   *   · engine.py's caches (decoded footage, scaled rasters, text, masks — up
   *     to ~1.3 GB at the caps) live per process. N children means N cold
   *     caches and N× the memory; one warm child beats two cold ones for the
   *     scrub-latency this lane exists for.
   *   · the serve protocol is strictly serial (answers in order, and render's
   *     progress lines are only unambiguous with one job in flight), so a
   *     child IS a queue; a pool would buy parallelism only for concurrent
   *     COLD frames, which the prewarm already had to throttle for CPU's sake.
   *   · a frame is ~30–300 ms of numpy on cores the per-call path also shared;
   *     the win being bought here is the 400 ms spawn, and one child buys all
   *     of it.
   *
   * WHAT RIDES IT AND WHAT DOES NOT: `frame` and `probe` — short, latency
   * bound, startup-dominated. `render` stays on the per-call path: it runs for
   * minutes to hours (it would wedge the serial queue behind it), and its
   * startup is amortised over its own frames. audiokeys.py and tracker.py are
   * different scripts with no serve mode.
   *
   * CRASH RESILIENCE: a child that dies mid-job fails that job with a
   * transport-marked error, and runEngineFast retries it once on the per-call
   * path — which stays fully intact below, is what `render` uses, and is the
   * fallback whenever the child cannot be (re)started. A failed start puts the
   * lane in a cooldown so a broken venv degrades to per-call spawning, not to
   * a spawn attempt per frame. A TIMEOUT kills the child (a serial process
   * cannot abandon a job; a wedged frame must not wedge every job behind it)
   * and is NOT retried — the caller's time budget is already spent.
   *
   * WINDOWS FILE LOCKS: the child keeps video containers open between jobs,
   * and Windows will not rename or delete a file a process holds open — the
   * per-call path never had this problem because it died after every frame.
   * Three answers: engine.py re-stats every cached source between jobs (an
   * edited file is dropped and re-read, so the frame cache key logic is
   * unchanged); `releaseSources()` is exported on the handler for the routes
   * that move library files aside; and an idle child releases everything by
   * itself after IDLE_RELEASE with no jobs.
   *
   * AIPLAY_VFX_NO_SERVE=1 pins everything to the per-call path — the A/B
   * switch the numbers above were measured with.

   *
   * WHY IT IS NOT `doc.updatedAt` ALONE, which is what it was. A comp layer
   * renders a CHILD document, so turning linearLight on (or moving a keyframe,
   * or anything else) inside the child changes the parent's pixels without
   * touching the parent's `updatedAt` — and the parent's frames were then
   * served from RAM and from disk after the edit that invalidated them, until
   * something else happened to touch the parent. This file states the rule
   * itself above `viewOf`: a render-affecting parameter that is not in the key
   * poisons the cache silently. The one parameter breaking it lived in another
   * document.
   *
   * FOLD AT READ TIME, rather than bumping every parent when a child is
   * written. Both close the hole; the fold was chosen for three reasons.
   *
   *   · There is no reverse index, and building one per write is the expensive
   *     direction. Nothing records who references a comp, and `listComps`
   *     returns summaries WITHOUT layers, so finding a slug's parents means
   *     reading every comp document in full — on every write, and a VFX write
   *     is one drag of a slider. The fold reads the children of ONE tree,
   *     bounded by MAX_COMP_DEPTH, and only for a comp that has children.
   *   · A bump writes something untrue. `updatedAt` is what `listComps` sorts
   *     by and what the page shows as the comp's own age; moving a parent's
   *     because a grandchild moved reorders the user's shelf for an edit they
   *     did not make to that comp.
   *   · A bump is a rule every future write path has to remember, and
   *     forgetting it is SILENT — which is exactly how this bug arrived. The
   *     fold is computed from the documents themselves at the moment the key is
   *     built, so no write path can forget it.
   *
   * MEASURED here, over 25 KB comp documents, 400 calls after a warm-up:
   * 3.2 ms per frame request for a root with three children, 3.2 ms again for a
   * depth-3 chain (it is the three file reads, not the depth), and 0.0006 ms
   * for a comp with no comp layers — that one walks its own `layers` array in
   * memory and stops. A frame that misses the cache costs a python; a frame
   * that hits it was already paying an HTTP round trip. NOTHING IS MEMOISED:
   * a memo with a TTL is this same bug with a shorter fuse, and an in-process
   * one would be wrong the moment a second server writes the same output
   * directory — which routes_ram_test.js does on purpose.
   *
   * THE TOKEN. With no children it is `Number(updatedAt).toString(36)` and
   * nothing about it changed — same cache key, same filename on disk, so every
   * frame an existing install has already rendered stays readable. With
   * children it is that, then a literal `n`, then a digest over every
   * (slug, updatedAt) beneath. It is opaque: only ever compared whole, never
   * parsed back, and it stays inside FRAME_RE's `[0-9a-z]+` so the on-disk
   * prune keeps matching.

   *  · It does not queue behind, or ahead of, interactive frames. It simply does
   *    not start one while a human is waiting; see `interactive`.
   *  · It does not outlive an edit. Every frame re-reads the comp and stops with
   *    status "stale" the moment `updatedAt` moves, because past that point it
   *    is filling a cache nothing will ever read.

         * First every source it names is checked against the library — §6's

         * is a percentage of the source's OWN pixels and "fill the frame" is
         * not computable from the comp alone; without the engine the probe
         * comes back null and the layer keeps 100%, which is a worse picture
         * but never an error.
         *
         * A source the caller simply did not give is not an error either: the
         * template degrades that layer to a solid, and the reply names every

         * The comment that used to sit here said a precomp could not be a live
         * nested render because §1 had no "comp" layer type. It has one now —
         * resolveChildComps and the engine's _child_comp render a layer of
         * type "comp" whose `src` names another comp's slug — so this action
         * is the real gesture: the named layers MOVE into a new comp of the
         * same width/height/fps/duration, byte for byte (ids, keyframes,
         * expressions, effects — everything), and ONE comp layer takes the
         * place of the topmost of them, spanning the parent's timeline. With
         * normal blends and no cross-boundary links, the rendered frame before
         * and after is the same picture — that is the claim of precompose, and
         * scripts/e2e_vfx.mjs proves it byte for byte.
         *
         * What crosses the boundary is handled the way AE handles it, WARNED
         * rather than silently:
         *   · a parent link with one end on each side is BROKEN (both
         *     directions — a moved child of a staying parent, and a staying
         *     child of a moved parent);
         *   · a track matte pair split across the boundary is broken — the
         *     matte is positional (the layer directly above), so leaving it
         *     set would silently matte against whatever lands there next;
         *   · an expression naming a layer on the other side (matched the way
         *     expressions.py resolves layer("x"): name first, then id, within
         *     one document) will fail at render — warned, not blocked, because
         *     the author may be about to fix the expression.
         * Precomposing EVERY layer is legal, as it is in AE: the parent is
         * left holding just the comp layer.
         *
         * AE's other mode, "leave all attributes" — transforms/effects/timing
         * stay on the parent layer and only the source goes down — is refused
         * by name below. Half-building it would corrupt timing silently.
         *
         * ORDERING: the child comp is created and filled BEFORE the parent is
         * touched, so a failure anywhere leaves the parent exactly as it was
         * (at worst an orphan comp sits in the picker, and the error names
         * it). The parent write re-checks the moved layers still exist, since
         * another writer may have slipped in between the read and the write.

   * This block used to REBUILD layer.camera out of four inRange'd scalars, and

   * reads seven fields off a camera, so pointOfInterest, focalLength and
   * blurLevel were silently DISCARDED on every write, and a keyed value could
   * not survive at all. migrate() preserves a rich camera and templates
   * finalize() never touches one, so a template could ship a camera rigged to

   * back with one field changed) destroyed it. Merging is the fix, and it is
   * the fix mergeLight has had all along: every animatable parameter goes
   * through the SAME resolver set_prop uses, so a wrong arity, an unknown name
   * and a dead lens spelling are all refused with the same words either way in.
   *
   * THE LENS SWITCH IS DECIDED FIRST AND RETIRED LAST, and the order is the
   * whole of it. This block used to retire the outgoing spelling before the
   * resolve loop, which left the camera holding NEITHER for the length of the
   * call — and resolvePropPath, reading the lens off the document the way
   * engine.py does, then refused every value in the very call that was
   * performing the switch. A millimetre camera could not be converted back to
   * pixels by any door at all, a camera with no lens field could not be given
   * one, and the refusal named a spelling the document did not contain. So:
   * decide the target spelling from the payload and the document TOGETHER
   * (cameraLensAfter), resolve and coerce everything against that decision,
   * and only then retire the other one. The document is never, at any
   * instant, a camera with no live lens.
