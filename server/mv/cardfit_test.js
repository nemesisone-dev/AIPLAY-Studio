/**
 * THE MUSIC VIDEO SCREENS FOLLOW THE CARD — the lane.
 *
 * What it pins, each against the code that acts on it rather than a copy:
 *
 *   1. ONE SIZE LIST. The brief's sizes are server/mv/sizes.js, whose three
 *      card tiers are server/h3tier.js's own rows; renderSize, the collab
 *      packet, the order that inverts it, set_brief's validation, the MCP enum
 *      and the page all read it. Every size and shape renders what it says.
 *   2. ONLY THE SHAPES THAT RENDER. 16:9 and 9:16; 1:1, 4:3 and 21:9 are
 *      refused at the door and never offered, and a project that stored one
 *      says it renders 16:9.
 *   3. A NEW VIDEO STARTS AT ITS CARD'S SIZE (none where H3 is not offered,
 *      the RAM included), and the longest scene follows the brief: 8 s at full
 *      size, 5 s at the smaller sizes and High, 15 s for an LTX project, each
 *      with where the number comes from.
 *   4. DEFAULT STEPS ARE THE MATCHED COUNT for the files on disk, sent and
 *      priced the same way and worded from the disk; a friend's render never
 *      takes the owner's disk's count.
 *   5. HYBRID SENDS A CAST-LESS SCENE TO LTX ONLY WHEN LTX IS HERE, and says so.
 *   6. STOP: the plan card's Stop cancels its clip on the engine and in the
 *      app's queue, the plan stays stopped, and its note says what was really
 *      reached; the rail's Stop (and only it) PAUSES a running plan and keeps
 *      every approval.
 *   7. A CLIP PAST THE WAIT IS FILED WHEN IT LANDS, a job taken off the queue
 *      is noticed at once, and a refused request says why.
 *   9. THE CUT LEAVES NO SUNG SECOND WITHOUT A PICTURE at any longest scene,
 *      on real songs' line timings and on a ballad with breaths.
 *
 * No server, no port, no GPU: the routes run in process into a temp folder,
 * with a stand-in art queue and a stand-in engine door, so nothing here can
 * reach a real render. Runs standalone (`node server/mv/cardfit_test.js`) and
 * in the pre-commit hook.
