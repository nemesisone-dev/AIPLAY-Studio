/**
 * Cover art — an IDLE-DRAIN queue, deliberately.
 *
 * Art must never make anyone wait for music. That is the whole design
 * constraint, and it is stronger than it first looks on a 16 GB card:
 *
 *   the music stack is ~14.1 GB resident (DiT fp16 4.91 + text encoder int8
 *   9.20), so there is NO headroom for the image models at any quantisation.
 *   Generating a cover always evicts the music models, and the next song then
 *   pays ~15 s to load them back.
 *
 * So the trigger is "the music queue is empty", not "a song finished". Ten
 * covers drained one-per-song is ten evictions; ten covers drained in one pass
 * is one. Historical FLUX measurement: 22.8 s for the first image (cold, loading 12.4 GB of
 * weights) against 3.3 s each once resident — so batching is worth roughly 4x
 * on an overnight run, which is the case that matters most.
 *
 * A new music job waits for the current image to finish, then the runner yields.
 * Render time depends on the selected engine; the FLUX timings above are not
 * a Qwen estimate.

 * lifetime of the process — that is the whole point of comfy.js keeping ONE
 * engine alive, and it buys an identical re-run in 0.3 s instead of 258 s. But
 * #clip finishes a render by MOVING the engine's file into the clip library,
 * and the library IS a subfolder of the engine's own output folder
 * (`<output>/clips`). So the second identical render is served from cache, the
 * SaveVideo node never executes, /history hands back the entry it wrote the
 * FIRST time — and the file that entry names was moved out from under it.
 * `rename` throws a bare ENOENT with two absolute Windows paths, and a render
 * that cost nothing and proved nothing is reported as a failure.
 *
 * Reproduced twice by hand, then measured on Video Lab's own first re-run:
 * both LTX arms failed this way in four seconds flat. That route papered over
 * it locally by spotting twin ARMS before rendering, which only helps inside
 * one comparison. An ordinary re-render of a clip you already have hits it too.
 *
 * THE KEY IS THE GRAPH, NOT THE PATH. Keying this on the engine's output path
 * would look simpler and be wrong: SaveVideo restarts its counter once the
 * folder is empty, so `clip_00001_.mp4` gets written again by the next
 * UNRELATED render, and a stale entry would hand back somebody else's video.
 * A graph is a total description of a render — prompt, seed, size, schedule,
 * references — so identical graph means identical output, which is exactly the
 * rule ComfyUI's own cache runs on. Hashing it can only ever agree with the
 * engine.

 * Ideogram steps — so a constant was fine. Base is 25 steps with real
 * classifier-free guidance, which is a batch of two through a 6.15B DiT, and
 * on a machine short of free RAM the streamed weights come off the pagefile:
 * measured at 41 s with 16 GB free and STILL RUNNING AT 13 MINUTES with 3.8 GB
 * free. The flat deadline fired at three minutes, the job was marked failed,
 * and ComfyUI carried on rendering it — the app and the GPU disagreeing about
 * whether work was happening, which is the worst of the available outcomes:
 * the picture that eventually lands belongs to a job the library gave up on.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE JOB SPACE IS BIGGER THAN ANY CONSTANT. The route clamps
 * width/height to 256..2048, steps to 60 on a checkpoint, and count to 4 — and
 * `count` batches INSIDE ONE PROMPT (see the two-SaveImage note in #render), so
 * all four pictures render under ONE deadline rather than four of them. The
 * worst job /api/image will cheerfully accept is therefore 2048² x 60 steps x
 * 4 slots x CFG on a cold SDXL checkpoint: several times 180 s on this card, so
 * the old constant did not make that job slow, it made it UNREACHABLE.
 *
 * So the cost is modelled the way the video path already models its own
 * (#clip below, which learned this exact lesson when a real user render was
 * killed with eleven minutes of GPU already spent), and every term is a factor
 * the route can actually vary:
 *
 *   PIXELS   quadratic in the side, so 2048² is 4x the work of 1024². This is
 *            the term the first version of this function missed.
 *   STEPS    linear, proven: Z-Image base measured 7.2 s at 6 steps and 23.3 s
 *            at 25, warm at 1024².
 *   COUNT    linear, because a batch samples every slot.
 *   CFG      x2 on the engines that evaluate an uncond branch (zimage-base,
 *            checkpoint). The distilled ones at cfg 1.0 never do.
 *
 * `imageCostSeconds` is the HONEST estimate — what the render should take on a
 * quiet machine. The padding lives in the deadline, on purpose, so the two can
 * be read and argued about separately.
 *
 * 0.6 s per model pass per megapixel is a little above what was measured here
 * (Z-Image base: 0.85 s/step at 1 MP with two passes = 0.42 s a pass), because
 * an estimate that only fits the fastest engine is not an estimate.
 *
 * THE MULTIPLIER IS 6, NOT THE VIDEO PATH'S 4, and the extra is bought with
 * evidence: this box runs TWO ComfyUI instances that between them held 15,749
 * of 16,376 MiB, and under that contention the same 1024² Z-Image base picture
 * went from 41 s to still-running-at-13-minutes because the streamed weights
 * came off the pagefile. A deadline that only covers a quiet machine is a
 * deadline that fires on the busy one, which is the case it exists for.
 *
 * Erring short costs a real picture; erring long costs a slow error message.
 * The 180 s floor is the old constant kept as a promise — nothing is ever given
 * less than it used to have — and with these terms nothing reaches it.
 *
 * Exported so scripts/test_workflow.mjs can pin the property that matters: the
