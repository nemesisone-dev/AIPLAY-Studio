/**
 * THE ROUTER — how a chat with eight tools reaches two hundred and forty-one.
 *
 * ── the arithmetic that forces this design ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The model behind this chat is Qwen3-4B and its context ceiling is 32,768
 * tokens. The MCP surface is 241 tools whose full descriptions and schemas come
 * to 360,287 characters, about 100,080 tokens. Pasting the library in is not a
 * thing that can be done badly; it is a thing that cannot be done. Even the
 * summary form — name plus first sentence — is 55,073 characters, some 15,298
 * tokens, which fits but leaves the conversation almost nothing and would slow
 * every turn on a card that is usually also rendering.
 *
 * The names alone are 3,860 characters. That is the fact this file is built on:
 * choosing is cheap, describing is expensive. So the message is matched against
 * all 241 names and summaries in JavaScript, costing no model call and no card,
 * and only the handful that match are described in full.
 *
 * ── why there is a hand-written table below ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The chat refuses to spend without asking, and that gate reads one field:
 * `spends`. NOT ONE of the 241 MCP tools declares it — they carry name,
 * description, inputSchema and run, and nothing about cost.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED, 2026-09-07, and the reason this table is typed out by hand rather
 * than computed. The obvious derivation is to read each tool's own source and
 * look for a mutating call, and it was tried: 206 of 241 came back "read-only".
 * The classification is wrong in the direction that matters. `avatar_import`,
 * `music_input_prepare` and `music_input_cancel` were all called free, because
 * they reach their writes through a helper rather than calling api("POST") in
 * the body the regular expression could see; `image_measure` and
 * `vfx_effect_presets` were called spending for the mirror-image reason. A
 * classifier that says a render is free is not a rough edge on this feature, it
 * is the feature failing: the person is asked for nothing and the card goes.
 *
 * So the gate is declared, per tool, in ROUTABLE. Three consequences, all
 * deliberate:
 *
 *   1. A tool that is not in the table is NOT REACHABLE from chat. Absence is
 *      refusal, never permission. This is the only default that is safe when
 *      the table is incomplete, and it is incomplete on purpose — the excluded
 *      list at the bottom says which tools were left out and why.
 *   2. `gate` is what needs the person's word, and it has two kinds, because
 *      "are you sure" is owed for two different reasons. "gpu" costs card time.
 *      "destroys" costs work that already exists. Marking a delete as GPU would
 *      have been the convenient lie; the prompt says which it is.
 *   3. Everything else is free and runs without a card — reads, catalogues,
 *      status, and the small writes that only move numbers in a document.
 *
 * ── what this file does NOT claim ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The table is a human judgement about 241 tools and human judgement about 241
 * of anything contains mistakes. It is biased so that its mistakes are the
 * survivable kind: when a tool was ambiguous it was gated, so the failure this
 * table produces is a needless confirmation rather than a silent render. If a
 * tool here is later found to spend while marked free, that is a defect in this
 * table and not in the loop, and it is fixed here.
