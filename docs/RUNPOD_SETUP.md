# RunPod rendering preview

**New to RunPod?** Follow the shorter [beginner quick start for Windows](RUNPOD_QUICKSTART.md) first. This page contains the technical details and limitations.

AIPLAY runs on your Windows PC. A small authenticated worker beside ComfyUI on a dedicated RunPod Pod executes workflows. Results are downloaded, SHA-256 checked, and placed in your local library. Your PC needs Node.js for AIPLAY's backend; it does not need CUDA or local model weights for this remote panel.

This is a source-level preview, not a signed Windows installer. RunPod is available as a render target in the normal Images and Video screens and for supported ComfyUI engines on the Music screen. The advanced workflow panel remains available for inspecting or importing graphs. The integration has automated coverage. The complete image path was validated on 24 September 2026 with a RunPod RTX PRO 4500 Blackwell, ComfyUI 0.30.0 and the SD 1.5 checkpoint. The complete video path was validated on 25 September 2026 with ComfyUI 0.37.0 and the official LTX 2.5 distilled model bundle. Connect, inventory, render, hash-checked download and local-library adoption passed in both cases. Music routing and local-library adoption have automated coverage; each music engine still requires its exact model bundle and compatible ComfyUI nodes to be installed and live-tested on the Pod.

## Start on Windows

In the launcher, press **Launch RunPod GPU**. It starts the full local interface without a local ComfyUI; the same mode from a terminal is:

```powershell
npm ci --omit=dev
npm run start:remote
```

In this mode the Images and Video screens render on the Pod: each shows a RunPod box (model on the Pod, remote size, **Connection…**) above the prompt. After that connection is configured, the normal Music queue also renders the ComfyUI-based MiniMax Music 3, ACE-Step 1.5 and YuE2 3B engines through the worker. Full Studio, Music only and Comfy API show none of the RunPod connection controls, and /api/runpod answers only in RunPod mode, because a Pod bills by the hour. The Images path renders standard ComfyUI checkpoints installed on the Pod. The Video path uses the installed LTX 2.5 distilled bundle for text-to-video. **Advanced workflow panel** in the connection window opens the graph panel (`/runpod.html`). Native YuE2 GGUF music, image references, video frames/references/soundtracks, mesh tools, compositor processing and final timeline export have not been connected to the integrated RunPod presets. Local editing/export tools can still have their own CPU, media-tool or Python requirements.

## Prepare one dedicated Pod

Choose a ComfyUI environment and GPU for one specific first workflow. A model-specific API such as Seedance includes its model deployment; a rented GPU does not. Confirm current compute and storage prices in the RunPod console before deploying. This integration does not create Pods, enforce a dollar budget, or stop idle GPUs.

1. Keep ComfyUI, model weights, its `input`/`output` folders, and worker state on persistent storage. A network volume can outlive the Pod, but has separate storage charges and placement constraints. See [RunPod storage options](https://docs.runpod.io/pods/storage/types) and [network volumes](https://docs.runpod.io/storage/network-volumes).
2. Install the selected models/custom nodes and prove a small workflow directly in that ComfyUI installation first. Start with a standard SD/SDXL checkpoint image to test transport cheaply. For video/music, install the exact files and nodes referenced by the chosen graph. The remote model list and graph validation report missing names; they do not install models or prove GPU memory is sufficient.
3. Keep ComfyUI on the Pod's loopback interface, normally `127.0.0.1:8188`. Use the template's Python environment, for example `python main.py --listen 127.0.0.1 --port 8188`. Configure the template so exactly one ComfyUI runs on the Pod. The worker input/output directories must match ComfyUI's actual directories. RunPod's current ComfyUI template uses `/workspace/runpod-slim/ComfyUI`; check the live Pod instead of assuming `/workspace/ComfyUI`.
4. Install Node.js 22 or newer in the Pod. Copy this checkout there, or clone this repository's `main` branch (the bootstrap below does). The gateway itself uses only Node built-ins: no `npm install` is required on the Pod. Required source files are `worker/runpod-worker.js`, `server/engine/remote-common.js`, and a root `package.json` with `"type": "module"`.
5. Expose only worker HTTP port **8787** for rendering. Keep raw ComfyUI port 8188 private. RunPod provides an HTTPS proxy such as `https://POD_ID-8787.proxy.runpod.net`; use the actual URL from the Pod's Connect panel. Public proxy services require their own authentication, and the proxy has a 100-second response timeout. The worker returns job IDs quickly and is polled separately. [RunPod port documentation](https://docs.runpod.io/pods/configuration/expose-ports).

On the Pod, generate a worker secret once and save it outside the source checkout:

```bash
mkdir -p /workspace/aiplay-worker
chmod 700 /workspace/aiplay-worker
node --input-type=module -e 'import { randomBytes } from "node:crypto"; import { writeFileSync } from "node:fs"; writeFileSync("/workspace/aiplay-worker/worker.env", "AIPLAY_WORKER_TOKEN=" + randomBytes(32).toString("hex") + "\n", { mode: 0o600, flag: "wx" });'
```

The exclusive write refuses to overwrite an existing token. Retrieve its value privately for the local connection form. This secret is **not your RunPod account API key**. Do not commit or share it.

Add the Pod-specific paths to the same private environment file:

```bash
cat >> /workspace/aiplay-worker/worker.env <<'EOF'
AIPLAY_COMFY_DIR=/workspace/runpod-slim/ComfyUI
AIPLAY_WORKER_COMFY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8188
AIPLAY_WORKER_STATE=/workspace/aiplay-worker
AIPLAY_WORKER_PORT=8787
EOF
```

From the copied checkout, start the gateway with the same Node runtime:

```bash
node --env-file=/workspace/aiplay-worker/worker.env worker/runpod-worker.js
```

Set this command up under the Pod template's startup supervisor for actual use, so it starts again on restart and does not depend on a browser terminal staying connected. Some RunPod ComfyUI images keep `/start.sh` as their entry point and pass a configured container command to it as an unused argument. For those images, install the included restart hook on the persistent ComfyUI volume:

```bash
mkdir -p /workspace/runpod-slim/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/aiplay_worker_autostart
cp /workspace/aiplay-worker-src/worker/comfyui-autostart/__init__.py \
  /workspace/runpod-slim/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/aiplay_worker_autostart/__init__.py
python -m py_compile /workspace/runpod-slim/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/aiplay_worker_autostart/__init__.py
```

The hook starts one worker when ComfyUI imports custom nodes and writes its log to `/workspace/aiplay-worker/worker.log`. Supervise ComfyUI separately. Do not run two worker processes against the same state directory.

| Environment variable | Default / purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AIPLAY_WORKER_TOKEN` | Required, at least 32 characters; use a random secret |
| `AIPLAY_COMFY_DIR` | `/workspace/ComfyUI` |
| `AIPLAY_WORKER_COMFY_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8188`; loopback only |
| `AIPLAY_WORKER_INPUT` | ComfyUI's `input` folder |
| `AIPLAY_WORKER_OUTPUT` | ComfyUI's `output` folder |
| `AIPLAY_WORKER_STATE` | `/workspace/aiplay-worker`; retain across restarts |
| `AIPLAY_WORKER_PORT` | `8787`; gateway listens on all interfaces |

## Connect and render

On Images or Video, choose **RunPod GPU**, open **Connection…**, and enter the worker HTTPS URL and token. The local backend stores the token through AIPLAY's existing secret store; it is never returned by the status API or placed in browser storage. Connect checks worker identity, ComfyUI readiness and its model/node inventory.

The same window has **Create or manage a RunPod Pod**. Add a restricted RunPod API key with permission to read GPU inventory and manage Pods. AIPLAY stores that key in the same local secret store and never returns it to the page after saving. It can then show the account balance, current hourly spend, existing Pods, live GPU stock/price estimates, and start/stop controls. See RunPod's [API-key guidance](https://docs.runpod.io/get-started/api-keys) and [Pod GraphQL operations](https://docs.runpod.io/sdks/graphql/manage-pods).

Creating a Pod is a reviewed paid action: choose the GPU, cloud tier and persistent disk, review the current estimated GPU hourly price, and explicitly acknowledge that billing begins before the create button is enabled. The current wizard creates the standard `runpod/comfyui:cuda12.8` image with HTTP ports 8080, 8188, 8888 and 8787. Storage is billed separately and may continue after compute is stopped.

After JupyterLab opens, copy the bootstrap command shown in the setup window into a terminal. It installs Node.js and the AIPLAY worker under `/workspace`, creates a private worker token, adds a ComfyUI restart hook, starts the worker, and prints the connection URL and token. The script is safe to run again and preserves the token. Model files are still a separate step because their licenses, access gates, size and required nodes vary by model.

For a first image, select the checkpoint shown under **Model on the Pod**, keep the default remote CFG 6, choose a small size and render. For a first video, keep **512 × 320 · cheapest test**, use a short duration, and render. Results appear in the normal Images or Clips library after their hashes are verified and the files are downloaded to the PC. The normal render buttons resume an active matching remote job after a page reload.

For custom graphs, open the advanced RunPod panel, select a template and model, enter the prompt, and build the graph. Review the editable workflow before rendering. You can instead import a ComfyUI **API-format** workflow; the canvas-format JSON is not accepted. Templates inherit AIPLAY defaults and may need model filenames edited to match the Pod.

For reference media, expand Add reference files and choose the graph node and input that should receive each file. The local file is uploaded and that input is replaced with a Pod-relative path. Merely importing a workflow that contains a Windows filename does not upload that file.

Render records the request locally before dispatching. Jobs show queued/running/downloading and final status. Image and video results are adopted into AIPLAY's local image/clip folders; supported audio goes into its local music library. Other supported output files remain downloadable from the job. Returning to the main studio may be needed to refresh a library view.

The worker and ComfyUI must stay running for the render to progress. Closing the PC UI does not stop the GPU job or Pod billing. Reopening AIPLAY resumes polling and downloads with the original job ID. Confirm that files are on the PC before terminating or removing remote storage. Manage compute and storage in the [RunPod console](https://console.runpod.io/).

## Recovery and limits

- Both sides persist job state. Retrying a lost desktop submission response uses the same UUID. A lost ComfyUI response is reconciled against its queue/history; it is never automatically rendered again. An **uncertain** result requires checking ComfyUI before creating another job.
- Keep the same worker state directory and URL for recovery. While a job is active, you can refresh its token, but cannot switch to another worker. Recreating a Pod at a new URL while local jobs are active currently requires manual recovery; this preview does not migrate outstanding jobs between endpoints.
- Cancellation targets one job. A ComfyUI version without targeted running-job cancellation will return an error; the worker deliberately does not send a global interrupt. A queued job can be withdrawn without stopping others. Inspect the Pod if cancellation fails.
- Files are limited to 512 MiB each, workflows to 2 MiB / 500 nodes, input bindings to 30, and the worker queue to 20 active jobs. Actual proxy transfer limits may be lower. Transfers restart from the beginning after interruption; large or slow transfers may need an SSH tunnel or a future object-storage transport.
- Outputs use a frozen size/hash manifest. Keep remote files until local download succeeds. There is no automated cleanup or retention expiry yet: monitor disk usage. Restart recovery is tested; hard power-loss durability and every third-party save node are not certified.
- No live progress percentage, automatic model installer, automatic Pod lifecycle control, multi-tenant isolation, or remote timeline/export support is included. This is a personal, dedicated worker: treat its bearer token as full access to its ComfyUI environment.

## Verify without cloud charges

```powershell
npm run test:remote
```

The integration tests use temporary directories and local mock HTTP services for authentication, model validation, uploads, download verification, submission loss, restart recovery, provenance and scoped cancellation.

For a browser demonstration, run `node scripts/mock-runpod.mjs` in one terminal. It prints a public test token and listens only on `http://127.0.0.1:8788`. In a second terminal:

```powershell
$env:AIPLAY_APPDATA = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'aiplay-runpod-demo'
$env:AIPLAY_UI_PORT = '4184'
npm run start:remote
```

Open port 4184's RunPod panel, connect the printed mock URL/token, select `MOCK-NO-GPU.safetensors`, build an image graph and render. The result is a tiny fixture PNG, not AI-generated media. Keep this demo's app-data separate from your real studio, and close both processes afterward.

## Live acceptance status

The first image acceptance test passed on 24 September 2026. A 512 x 512 SD 1.5 job completed remotely in about 26 seconds, returned both its full image and thumbnail, passed the declared byte-count and SHA-256 checks, and was adopted into the local AIPLAY image library.

The first video acceptance test passed on 25 September 2026. A 512 x 320, 25-frame LTX 2.5 job completed remotely in 172 seconds after the initial model load. It produced a 24 fps H.264/AAC MP4 lasting 1.042 seconds. The local download matched the worker's 370,008-byte size and SHA-256 digest and was adopted into the AIPLAY clip library. The tested worker reported an RTX PRO 4500 Blackwell with 32,623 MiB VRAM and ComfyUI 0.37.0. AIPLAY accepts both legacy ComfyUI model-choice lists and the newer `COMBO` input schema used by this version.

H3's licence excludes use in the EU and several other territories. LTX 2.5 is the suitable built-in route for this EU deployment, but its repository is access-gated and its model bundle is about 40 GB. Accept its publisher licence and provide Hugging Face access before downloading it, then verify that the Pod's ComfyUI version exposes every node in the generated LTX graph.
